<p>A swift action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy than a <a href="SRD_Free_Actions.html" title="SRD:Free Actions">free action</a>. You can perform one swift action per turn without affecting your ability to perform other actions. In that regard, a swift action is like a <a href="SRD_Free_Actions.html" title="SRD:Free Actions">free action</a>. However, you can perform only a single swift action per turn, regardless of what other actions you take. You can take a swift action any time you would normally be allowed to take a <a href="SRD_Free_Actions.html" title="SRD:Free Actions">free action</a>. Swift actions usually involve psionics or the activation of psionic items; many characters (especially those who donâ€™t use psionics) never have an opportunity to take a swift action.
</p><p>Manifesting a quickened power is a swift action. In addition, manifesting any power with a casting time of 1 swift action is a swift action.
</p><p>Manifesting a power with a manifesting time of 1 swift action does not provoke <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a>.
