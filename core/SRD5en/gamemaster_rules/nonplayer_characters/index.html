<h2 id="customizing-npcs">Customizing NPCs</h2>
<p>There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs for your home campaign.  <br/>
<strong>Racial Traits.</strong> You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a halfling <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/druid/index.html">Druid</a> might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn't alter its challenge rating. For more on racial traits, see the Player's Handbook.  <br/>
<strong>Spell Swaps.</strong> One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC's spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn't alter an NPC's challenge rating.  <br/>
<strong>Armor and Weapon Swaps.</strong> You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC's armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an NPC's challenge rating.  <br/>
<strong>Magic Items.</strong> The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. An <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/archmage/index.html">Archmage</a>, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.</p></div>
