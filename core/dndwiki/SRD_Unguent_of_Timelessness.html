<p><b>Unguent of Timelessness:</b> When applied to any matter that was once alive this ointment allows that substance to resist the passage of time.

The coated object gains a +1 resistance bonus on all <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throws</a>. The unguent never wears off, although it can be magically removed (by dispelling the effect, for instance). One flask contains enough material to coat eight Medium or smaller objects. A Large object counts as two Medium objects, and a Huge object counts as two Large objects.
