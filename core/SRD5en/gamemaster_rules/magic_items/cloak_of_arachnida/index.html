<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em> </p>
<p>This fine garment is made of black silk interwoven with faint silvery threads. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have resistance to poison damage.</li>
<li>You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</li>
<li>You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.</li>
<li>You can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/combat/movement_and_position/index.html#difficult-terrain">Difficult Terrain</a>.</li>
<li>You can use an action to cast the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/web/index.html">Web</a></em></strong> spell (save DC 13). The web created by the spell fills twice its normal area. Once used, this property of the cloak can't be used again until the next dawn. </li>
