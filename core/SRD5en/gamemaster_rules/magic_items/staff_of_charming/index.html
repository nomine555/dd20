<p><em>Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/druid/index.html">Druid</a>, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)</em> </p>
<p>While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 10 charges to cast <strong><em>*C<a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/harm/index.html">Harm</a> Person*</em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/command/index.html">Command</a></em></strong>, or <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/comprehend_languages/index.html">Comprehend Languages</a></em></strong> from it using your spell save DC. The staff can also be used as a magic quarterstaff.  <br/>
If you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property of the staff again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell that targets only you, with or without the staff's intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.  <br/>
The staff regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff. </p></div>
