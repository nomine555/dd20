<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="ring-of-shooting-stars">Ring of Shooting Stars</h1>
<p><em>Ring, very rare (requires attunement outdoors at night)</em> </p>
<p>While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast <strong><em>*Dancing <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/light/index.html">Light</a>s*</em></strong> and <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/light/index.html">Light</a></em></strong> from the ring at will. Casting either spell from the ring requires an action.  <br/>
The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.  <br/>
<strong>Faerie Fire.</strong> You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/faerie_fire/index.html">Faerie Fire</a></em></strong> from the ring. <br/>
<strong>Ball Lightning.</strong> You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.  <br/>
Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.  <br/>
As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created. </p>

<p><strong>Shooting Stars.</strong> You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a DC 15 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p></div>
