<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> The knight makes two melee attacks.  <br/>
<strong>Greatsword.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.  <br/>
<strong>Heavy Crossbow.</strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +2 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d10) piercing damage.  <br/>
<strong>Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).</strong> For 1 minute, the knight can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the knight. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the knight is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Incapacitated</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Parry.</strong> The knight adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon. </p>

Whether undertaking a quest or patrolling a realm, a knight often travels with an entourage that includes squires and hirelings who are <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/commoner/index.html">commoners</a>. </p></div>
