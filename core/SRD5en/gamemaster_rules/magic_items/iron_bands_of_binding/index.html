<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="iron-bands-of-binding">Iron Bands of Binding</h1>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em> </p>
<p>This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.  <br/>
Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a> until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.  <br/>
A creature, including the one <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a>, can use an action to make a DC 20 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a> creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.  <br/>
Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn. </p></div>
