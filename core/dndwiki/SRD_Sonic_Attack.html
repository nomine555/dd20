<p>Unless otherwise noted, a sonic attack follows the rules for spreads. The range of the spread is measured from the creature using the sonic attack. Once a sonic attack has taken effect, deafening the subject or stopping its ears does not end the effect. Stopping one’s ears ahead of time allows opponents to avoid having to make <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throws</a> against mind-affecting sonic attacks, but not other kinds of sonic attacks (such as those that deal damage). Stopping one’s ears is a <a href="SRD_Full-Round_Actions.html" title="SRD:Full-Round Actions">full-round action</a> and requires wax or other soundproof material to stuff into the ears.
