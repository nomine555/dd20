<p><b>Sutra of Tranquil Thought:</b> This monastic tome describes ancient techniques of mental focus and is highly prized by psionic practitioners. If a psionic character who is not evil studies the work during one week of solitary contemplation, he gains 17 bonus <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> and experience points sufficient to place him halfway into the next level of experience. Those who use their <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> for evil are punished for their impertinence, losing 5d6 x 1,000 XP for defiling the book. In addition, an evil reader must make an immediate <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Will</a> save or become permanently <i><a href="SRD_Confused.html" title="SRD:Confused">confused</a> </i>as if affected by the <i><a href="SRD_Insanity_(Power).html" title="SRD:Insanity (Power)">insanity</a></i> power. Only <i><a href="SRD_Psychic_Chirurgery.html" title="SRD:Psychic Chirurgery">psychic chirurgery</a></i> or similarly extreme measures can restore sanity.
</p><p>The minds of nonpsionic beings are too clouded to benefit from the secrets of this book. To anyone without psionic aptitude, the bookâ€™s pages appear to contain nothing but elaborate patterns and drawings of mysterious beings. Once it is read, the book vanishes into the <a href="SRD_Astral_Plane.html" title="SRD:Astral Plane">Astral Plane</a> to an unknown destination. Even if it is found again, the same character cannot benefit twice from perusing its contents.
