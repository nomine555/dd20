<p><em>4th-level divination (ritual)</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Self  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p>Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god's servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.  <br/>
The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.  <br/>
If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret. </p></div>
