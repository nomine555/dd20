<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="School_Specialization">School Specialization</span></h4>
<p>A school is one of eight groupings of spells, each defined by a common theme. If desired, a <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> may specialize in one school of magic (see below). Specialization allows a <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> to cast extra spells from her chosen school, but she then never learns to cast spells from some other schools.
</p><p>A specialist <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> can prepare one additional spell of her specialty school per <a href="SRD_Spell_Level.html" title="SRD:Spell Level" class="mw-redirect">spell level</a> each day. She also gains a +2 bonus on <a href="SRD_Spellcraft_Skill.html" title="SRD:Spellcraft Skill">Spellcraft</a> checks to learn the spells of her chosen school.
</p><p>The <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> must choose whether to specialize and, if she does so, choose her specialty at 1st level. At this time, she must also give up two other schools of magic (unless she chooses to specialize in divination; see below), which become her prohibited schools.
</p><p>A <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> can never give up <a href="SRD_Divination_School.html" title="SRD:Divination School">divination</a> to fulfill this requirement.
</p><p>Spells of the prohibited school or schools are not available to the <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a>, and she canâ€™t even cast such spells from scrolls or fire them from wands. She may not change either her specialization or her prohibited schools later.
</p><p>The eight schools of arcane magic are abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation.
</p><p>Spells that do not fall into any of these schools are called universal spells.
</p><p><i><span id="Abjuration"><a href="SRD_Abjuration_School.html" title="SRD:Abjuration School">Abjuration</a></span>:</i> Spells that protect, block, or banish. An abjuration specialist is called an abjurer.
</p><p><i><span id="Conjuration"><a href="SRD_Conjuration_School.html" title="SRD:Conjuration School">Conjuration</a></span>:</i> Spells that bring creatures or materials to the caster. A conjuration specialist is called a conjurer.
</p><p><i><span id="Divination"><a href="SRD_Divination_School.html" title="SRD:Divination School">Divination</a></span>:</i> Spells that reveal information. A divination specialist is called a diviner. Unlike the other specialists, a diviner must give up only one other school.
</p><p><i><span id="Enchantment"><a href="SRD_Enchantment_School.html" title="SRD:Enchantment School">Enchantment</a></span>:</i> Spells that imbue the recipient with some property or grant the caster power over another being. An enchantment specialist is called an enchanter.
</p><p><i><span id="Evocation"><a href="SRD_Evocation_School.html" title="SRD:Evocation School">Evocation</a></span>:</i> Spells that manipulate energy or create something from nothing. An evocation specialist is called an evoker.
</p><p><i><span id="Illusion"><a href="SRD_Illusion_School.html" title="SRD:Illusion School">Illusion</a></span>:</i> Spells that alter perception or create false images. An illusion specialist is called an illusionist.
</p><p><i><span id="Necromancy"><a href="SRD_Necromancy_School.html" title="SRD:Necromancy School">Necromancy</a></span>:</i> Spells that manipulate, create, or destroy life or life force. A necromancy specialist is called a necromancer.
</p><p><i><span id="Transmutation"><a href="SRD_Transmutation_School.html" title="SRD:Transmutation School">Transmutation</a></span>:</i> Spells that transform the recipient physically or change its properties in a more subtle way. A transmutation specialist is called a transmuter.
</p><p><i><span id="Universal"><a href="SRD_Universal_School.html" title="SRD:Universal School">Universal</a></span>:</i> Not a school, but a category for spells that all <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizards</a> can learn. A <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> cannot select universal as a specialty school or as a prohibited school. Only a limited number of spells fall into this category.
