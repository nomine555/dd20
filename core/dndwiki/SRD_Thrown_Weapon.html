<p>Daggers, clubs, shortspears, spears, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers, tridents, shuriken, and nets are thrown weapons. The wielder applies his or her <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> modifier to damage dealt by thrown weapons (except for splash weapons). It is possible to throw a weapon that isn’t designed to be thrown (that is, a <a href="SRD_Melee_Weapon.html" title="SRD:Melee Weapon">melee weapon</a> that doesn’t have a numeric entry in the Range Increment column on Table: Weapons), but a character who does so takes a –4 penalty on the <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack roll</a>. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a <a href="SRD_Full-Round_Actions.html" title="SRD:Full-Round Actions">full-round action</a>. Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a <a href="SRD_Critical_Hit.html" title="SRD:Critical Hit" class="mw-redirect">critical hit</a>. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.
