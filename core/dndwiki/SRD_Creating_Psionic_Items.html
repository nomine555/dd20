<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_Psionic_Items">Creating Psionic Items</span></h2>
<p>To calculate the costs involved in creating a psionic item, refer to Creating Magic Items. Although that information deals with magic items, the price formulas presented there are identical to those for psionic items.
</p><p>Creating psionic armor and psionic weapons is almost identical to the requirements for creating magic armor and magic weapons.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_Dorjes">Creating Dorjes</span></h4>
<p>To create a dorje, a character needs a small supply of materials, the most obvious being a chunk of crystal or the crystal shards of the dorje to be carved from or assembled. The cost of the materials is subsumed in the cost of creating the dorje—375 gp &#215; the level of the power &#215; the level of the manifester. Dorjes are always fully charged (50 charges) when created.
</p><p>If an augmentable power is incorporated into a dorje at a higher <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a> than the minimum level required to manifest the power, each discharge of the power from the dorje is augmented to the limit of that higher <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>. Alternatively, if you want to have a higher <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a> in the dorje, you must pay for the dorje as if the power was one level higher for each additional two <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester levels</a> you want. 
</p><p>The creator must know the power or <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> to be imprinted in the dorje (or must have the power available in some other form). If manifesting the power would reduce the manifester’s experience point total, she pays the cost (multiplied by 50) upon beginning the dorje in addition to the experience point cost for making the dorje itself. The act of working on the dorje costs a number of <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> per day equal to the <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power point</a> cost of the power that is being embedded in the crystal of the dorje.
</p><p>Crafting a dorje requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_Power_Stones">Creating Power Stones</span></h4>
<p>To create a power stone, a character needs a supply of incense and fine etching tools, the cost of which is subsumed in the cost of encoding the power stone—12.5 gp &#215; the level of the power &#215; the level of the manifester. All materials used to imprint a power stone must be fresh and unused. A character must pay the full cost for encoding each power stone no matter how many times she previously has imprinted the same power.
</p><p>The creator must know the power or <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> to be imprinted in the power stone (or must have the power available in some other form). If manifesting the power would reduce the manifester’s experience point total, she pays the cost upon beginning the power stone in addition to the experience point cost for making the power stone itself. The act of encoding triggers the power as if it had been manifested, costing the character an appropriate number of <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a>.
</p><p>Encoding a power stone requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_Psicrowns">Creating Psicrowns</span></h4>
<p>To create a psicrown, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being a circlet, crown, or the pieces of the crown to be assembled. The cost of the materials is subsumed in the cost of creating the psicrown—375 gp &#215; the level of the highest-level power &#215; the level of the manifester, + 75% of the value of the next highest-level power (281.25 gp &#215; the level of the power &#215; the level of the manifester), + one-half of the value of any other <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> (187.5 gp &#215; the level of the power &#215; the level of the manifester). Psicrowns are always created with full <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a>.
</p><p>Alternatively, if you want to have a higher <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a> in the psicrown, you must pay for the psicrown as if the highest-level power is one level higher for each additional two <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester levels</a> you want.
</p><p>The creator must know the power or <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> to be imprinted in the psicrown (or must have the power available in some other form). If any of the <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> has an XP cost, the creator must provide XP equal to 50 &#215; that cost. This expense is in addition to the experience point cost for making the psicrown itself. The act of working on a psicrown costs a number of <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> per day equal to the cost of manifesting each of the <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> associated with the psicrown once per day.
</p><p>Crafting a psicrown requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_Psionic_Tattoos">Creating Psionic Tattoos</span></h4>
<p>The creator of a psionic tattoo must have a patch of uncovered skin free of hair and fur, and at least a few containers in which to mix dyes. In addition, he needs special materials, usually to create dyes. The costs for materials and dyes are subsumed in the cost for scribing the psionic tattoo—25 gp &#215; the level of the power &#215; the level of the manifester. All ingredients and materials used to scribe a psionic tattoo must be fresh and unused. The character must pay the full cost for scribing each psionic tattoo. (Economies of scale do not apply.)
</p><p>The user of the psionic tattoo is both the manifester and the target; therefore, <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> that target another creature cannot be stored in psionic tattoo form. <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">Powers</a> with a range of personal can be made into psionic tattoos, but they cost double the price of standard psionic tattoos.
</p><p>The creator must know the power to be placed in the psionic tattoo (or must have the power available in some other form). If manifesting the power would reduce the manifester’s XP total, he pays the XP cost upon beginning the scribing in addition to the experience point cost for making the psionic tattoo itself. The act of scribing triggers the power as if it had been manifested, costing the character an appropriate number of <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a>.
</p><p>Scribing a psionic tattoo requires one day.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_Universal_Items">Creating Universal Items</span></h4>
<p>To create a universal item, a character usually needs some sort of equipment or tools to work on the item. He also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the item itself or the pieces of the item to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the item. Universal item costs are difficult to formularize. Refer to Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values and use the given item prices as a guideline. Creating an item costs half the market value listed.
</p><p>If <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> are involved in the prerequisites for making the item, the creator must know the power to be placed in the item (or must have the power available in some other form). Any experience point cost for a prerequisite power is not incurred by the creator of the item. The act of working on the item requires a payment of <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> appropriate to the power or <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> associated with the item during each day of the item’s creation.
</p><p>Crafting a universal item requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.
