<p>Your pointing finger turns black as obsidian. A creature touched by you is partially assimilated into your form and takes 20d6 points of damage. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> by this power is killed, entirely assimilated into your form, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. An assimilated creatureâ€™s equipment is unaffected.
</p><p>A creature that is partially assimilated into your form (that is, a creature that has at least 1 hit point following your use of this power) grants you a number of temporary <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> equal to half the damage you dealt for 1 hour.
</p><p>A creature that is completely assimilated grants you a number of temporary <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> equal to the damage you dealt and a +4 bonus to each of your ability scores for 1 hour. If the assimilated creature knows psionic <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, you gain knowledge of one of its <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> for 1 hour. You gain some semblance of a creature you completely assimilate for 1 hour, granting you a +10 bonus on <a href="SRD_Disguise_Skill.html" title="SRD:Disguise Skill">Disguise</a> checks made to appear as that creature during that time.
