<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/bandit/index.html">bandits</a> in line. The <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/bandit/index.html">Bandit</a> captain has these qualities in spades. In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the pirate captain is a variation of the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/bandit/index.html">Bandit</a> captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis. More than treasure, a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/bandit/index.html">Bandit</a> captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain's colorful reputation. </p></div>
