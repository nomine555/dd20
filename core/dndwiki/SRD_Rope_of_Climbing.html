<p><b>Rope of Climbing:</b> A 60-foot-long <i>rope of climbing </i>is no thicker than a wand, but it is strong enough to support 3,000 pounds. Upon command, the rope snakes forward, upward, downward, or in any other direction at 10 feet per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, attaching itself securely wherever its owner desires. It can unfasten itself and return in the same manner.
</p><p>A <i>rope of climbing </i>can be commanded to knot or unknot itself. This causes large knots to appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. Knotting shortens the rope to a 50-foot length until the knots are untied but lowers the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> of <a href="SRD_Climb_Skill.html" title="SRD:Climb Skill">Climb checks</a> while using it by 10.
