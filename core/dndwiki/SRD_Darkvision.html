<p>Darkvision is the <a href="SRD_Extraordinary_Ability.html" title="SRD:Extraordinary Ability" class="mw-redirect">extraordinary ability</a> to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified for the creature. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwiseâ€”<a href="SRD_Invisible.html" title="SRD:Invisible">invisible</a> objects are still <a href="SRD_Invisible.html" title="SRD:Invisible">invisible</a>, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.
