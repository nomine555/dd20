<p>The character can use song or poetics to grant a bonus to one <a href="SRD_Ability_Scores.html" title="SRD:Ability Scores">ability score</a> to his or her allies. To be affected, an ally must hear the <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a> sing for 1 full <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. The effect lasts as long as the <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a> sings and for 5 rounds after the <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a> stops singing (or 5 rounds after the ally can no longer hear the <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a>). While singing, the <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a> can fight but cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by <a href="SRD_Command.html" title="SRD:Command">command</a> word (such as wands). Each ally to be inspired gains a +4 competence bonus to the same <a href="SRD_Ability_Scores.html" title="SRD:Ability Scores">ability score</a>, which the character must choose before he or she begins inspiring.
