<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="magic-circle">Magic Circle</h1>
<p><em>3rd-level abjuration</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour 
You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.  <br/>
Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>The creature can't willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/charisma/index.html">Charisma</a> saving throw.</li>
<li>The creature has <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.</li>
<li>Targets within the cylinder can't be <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a>, <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Frightened</a>, or possessed by the creature. </li>
</ul>
<p>When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it. </p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd. </p></div>
