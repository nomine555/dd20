<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em> </p>
<p>This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/fireball/index.html">Fireball</a></em></strong> spell (save DC 15).  <br/>
You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/fireball/index.html">Fireball</a></em></strong> by 1 for each bead beyond the first.</p></div>
