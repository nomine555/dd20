<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Elemental_Plane_of_Fire">Elemental Plane of Fire</span></h3>
<p>Everything is alight on the <a href="SRD_Elemental_Type.html" title="SRD:Elemental Type">Elemental</a> Plane of Fire. The ground is nothing more than great, evershifting plates of compressed flame. The air ripples with the heat of continual firestorms, and the most common liquid is magma, not water. The oceans are made of liquid flame, and the mountains <a href="SRD_Ooze_Type.html" title="SRD:Ooze Type">ooze</a> with molten lava. Fire survives here without need for fuel or air, but flammables brought onto the plane are consumed readily. 
</p><p>The <a href="SRD_Elemental_Type.html" title="SRD:Elemental Type">Elemental</a> Plane of Fire has the following traits.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire-dominant.
</li>
<li>Enhanced magic. Spells and <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like abilities</a> with the fire descriptor are both maximized and enlarged (as if the Maximize Spell and Enlarge Spell had been used on them, but the spells donâ€™t require higher-level slots). Spells and <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like abilities</a> that are already maximized or enlarged are unaffected by this benefit.
</li>
<li>Impeded magic. Spells and <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like abilities</a> that use or create water (including spells of the Water domain and spells that summon water <a href="SRD_Elemental_Type.html" title="SRD:Elemental Type">elementals</a> or <a href="SRD_Outsider_Type.html" title="SRD:Outsider Type">outsiders</a> with the water subtype) are impeded. 
</li>
</ul>
