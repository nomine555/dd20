<p>When reduced to between –1 and –9 <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>, you automatically become <a href="SRD_Stable.html" title="SRD:Stable">stable</a>. You don’t have to roll d% to see if you lose 1 hit point each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>.
</p><p>When reduced to negative <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>, you may choose to act as if you were <a href="SRD_Disabled.html" title="SRD:Disabled">disabled</a>, rather than <a href="SRD_Dying.html" title="SRD:Dying">dying</a>. You must make this decision as soon as you are reduced to negative <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> (even if it isn’t your turn). If you do not choose to act as if you were <a href="SRD_Disabled.html" title="SRD:Disabled">disabled</a>, you immediately fall unconscious.
</p><p>When using this <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>, you can take either a single move or <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> each turn, but not both, and you cannot take a full <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> action. You can take a <a href="SRD_Move_Actions.html" title="SRD:Move Actions">move action</a> without further injuring yourself, but if you perform any <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> (or any other action deemed as strenuous, including some <a href="SRD_Free_Actions.html" title="SRD:Free Actions">free actions</a>, such as casting a quickened spell) you take 1 point of damage after completing the act. If you reach –10 <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>, you immediately die.
