<p><b>The Shield of the Sun:</b> This <i>+5 <a href="SRD_Heavy_Shield.html" title="SRD:Heavy Shield">large shield</a>, </i>emblazoned with the symbol of the sun, allows the wielder to cast spells as if she were a 20th-level <a href="SRD_Paladin.html" title="SRD:Paladin">paladin</a> with a <a href="SRD_Wisdom.html" title="SRD:Wisdom">Wisdom</a> score of 20. The spells gained are cumulative with any existing spells per day that the character might have, even if she’s already a <a href="SRD_Paladin.html" title="SRD:Paladin">paladin</a>. The <i>Shield of the Sun </i>also grants <a href="SRD_Spell_Resistance.html" title="SRD:Spell Resistance" class="mw-redirect">spell resistance</a> 15 to its wielder. It absorbs the first 10 points of damage from any energy attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic). In return for all this, once per year the shield’s owner must undertake a quest (no <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> to avoid) at the behest of a lawful good deity. 
</p><p>A character who is evil or chaotic (LE, NE, CE, CN, CG) gains four <a href="SRD_Energy_Drain%2c_Negative_Levels%2c_and_Level_Loss.html#Negative_Levels" title="SRD:Energy Drain, Negative Levels, and Level Loss">negative levels</a> if she attempts to use this artifact. Although these negative levels never results in actual level loss, they remain as long as the shield is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including <i><a href="SRD_Restoration.html" title="SRD:Restoration">restoration</a> </i>spells). The negative levels disappear when the shield is stowed or leaves the wearer’s possession.
