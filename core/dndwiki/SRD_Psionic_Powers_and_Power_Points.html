<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Powers_and_Power_Points">Powers and Power Points</span></h2>
<p>Psionic characters manifest <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, which involve the direct manipulation of personal mental energy. These manipulations require natural talent and personal meditation. A psionic character’s level limits the number of <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> available to manifest <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>. A psionic character’s relevant high score might allow him to gain extra <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a>. He can manifest the same power more than once, but each manifestation subtracts <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> from his daily limit. Manifesting a power is an arduous mental task. To do so, a psionic character must have a <a href="SRD_Key_Ability.html" title="SRD:Key Ability" class="mw-redirect">key ability</a> score of at least 10 + the power’s level.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Daily_Power_Point_Acquisition">Daily Power Point Acquisition</span></h5>
<p>To regain used daily <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a>, a psionic character must have a clear mind. To clear his mind, he must first sleep for 8 hours. The character does not have to slumber for every minute of the time, but he must refrain from movement, combat, manifesting <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, skill use, conversation, or any other demanding physical or mental task during the rest period. If his rest is interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour to the total amount of time he has to rest to clear his mind, and he must have at least 1 hour of rest immediately prior to regaining lost <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a>. If the character does not need to sleep for some reason, he still must have 8 hours of restful calm before regaining <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a>.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Recent_Manifesting_Limit.2FRest_Interruptions">Recent Manifesting Limit/Rest Interruptions</span></h5>
<p>If a psionic character has manifested <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> recently, the drain on his resources reduces his capacity to regain <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a>. When he regains <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> for the coming day, all <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> he has used within the last 8 hours count against his daily limit.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Peaceful_Environment">Peaceful Environment</span></h5>
<p>To regain <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a>, a psionic character must have enough peace, quiet, and comfort to allow for proper concentration. The psionic character’s surroundings need not be luxurious, but they must be free from overt distractions, such as combat raging nearby or other loud noises. Exposure to inclement weather prevents the necessary concentration, as does any injury or failed <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> the character might incur while concentrating on regaining <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a>.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Regaining_Power_Points">Regaining Power Points</span></h5>
<p>Once the character has rested in a suitable environment, it takes only an act of concentration spanning 1 full <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> to regain all <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> of the psionic character’s daily limit. 
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Death_and_Power_Points">Death and Power Points</span></h5>
<p>If a character dies, all daily <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> stored in his mind are wiped away. A potent effect (such as <i>reality revision</i>) can recover the lost <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> when it recovers the character.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Adding_Powers">Adding <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">Powers</a></span></h3>
<p>Psionic characters can learn new <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> when they attain a new level. A psion can learn any power from the psion/wilder list and <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> from his chosen discipline’s list. A <a href="SRD_Wilder.html" title="SRD:Wilder">wilder</a> can learn any power from the psion/wilder list. A <a href="SRD_Psychic_Warrior.html" title="SRD:Psychic Warrior">psychic warrior</a> can learn any power from the <a href="SRD_Psychic_Warrior.html" title="SRD:Psychic Warrior">psychic warrior</a> list. 
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Powers_Gained_at_a_New_Level">Powers Gained at a New Level</span></h5>
<p>Psions and other psionic characters perform a certain amount of personal meditation between adventures in an attempt to unlock latent mental abilities. Each time a psionic character attains a new level, he or she learns additional <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> according to his <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> description. Psions, <a href="SRD_Psychic_Warrior.html" title="SRD:Psychic Warrior">psychic warriors</a>, and <a href="SRD_Wilder.html" title="SRD:Wilder">wilders</a> learn new <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> of their choice in this fashion. These <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> represent abilities unlocked from latency. The <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> must be of levels the characters can manifest.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Independent_Research">Independent Research</span></h5>
<p>A psion also can research a power independently, duplicating an existing power or creating an entirely new one. If characters are allowed to develop new <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, use these guidelines to handle the situation.
</p><p>Any kind of manifester can create a new power. The research involved requires access to a retreat conducive to uninterrupted meditation. Research involves an expenditure of 200 XP per week and takes one week per level of the power. At the end of that time, the character makes a <a href="SRD_Psicraft_Skill.html" title="SRD:Psicraft Skill">Psicraft</a> check (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 10 + <a href="SRD_Spell_Level.html" title="SRD:Spell Level" class="mw-redirect">spell level</a>). If that check succeeds, the character learns the new power if her research produced a viable power. If the check fails, the character must go through the research process again if she wants to keep trying.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Manifest_an_Unknown_Power_from_Another.E2.80.99s_Powers_Known">Manifest an Unknown Power from Another’s <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">Powers</a> Known</span></h4>
<p>A psionic character can attempt to manifest a power from a source other than his own knowledge (usually a power stone or another willing psionic character). To do so, the character must first make contact (a process similar to addressing a power stone, requiring a <a href="SRD_Psicraft_Skill.html" title="SRD:Psicraft Skill">Psicraft</a> check against a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> of 15 + the <s>level of the power to be manifested </s><span class="errata">highest level power in the power stone or repertoire</span>). A psionic character can make contact with only a willing psionic character or creature (unconscious creatures are considered willing, but not psionic characters under the effects of other immobilizing conditions). Characters who can’t use power stones for any reason are also banned from attempting to manifest <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> from the knowledge of other psionic characters. Mental contact requires 1 full <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> of physical contact, which can provoke <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a>. Once contact is achieved, the character becomes aware of all the <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> stored in the power stone or all the <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> the other character knows up to the highest level of power the contactor knows himself. 
</p><p>Next, the psionic character must choose one of the <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> and make a second <a href="SRD_Psicraft_Skill.html" title="SRD:Psicraft Skill">Psicraft</a> check (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 + the power’s level) to see if he understands it. If the power is not on his <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> list, he automatically fails this check.
</p><p>Upon successfully making contact with another willing psionic character or creature and learning what he can of one power in particular, the character can immediately attempt to manifest that power even if he doesn’t know it (and assuming he has <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> left for the day). He can attempt to manifest the power normally on his next turn, and he succeeds if he makes one additional <a href="SRD_Psicraft_Skill.html" title="SRD:Psicraft Skill">Psicraft</a> check (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 + the power’s level). He retains the ability to manifest the selected power for only 1 <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. If he doesn’t manifest the power, fails the <a href="SRD_Psicraft_Skill.html" title="SRD:Psicraft Skill">Psicraft</a> check, or manifests a different power, he loses his chance to manifest that power for the day.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Using_Stored_Power_Points">Using Stored Power Points</span></h3>
<p>A variety of psionic items exist to store <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> for later use, in particular a storage device called a <i>cognizance crystal</i>. Regardless of what sort of item stores the <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a>, all psionic characters must follow strict rules when tapping stored <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a>.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="A_Single_Source">A Single Source</span></h5>
<p>When using <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> from a storage item to manifest a power, a psionic character may not pay the power’s cost with <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> from more than one source. He must either use an item, his own <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power point</a> reserve, or some other discrete <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power point</a> source to pay the manifestation cost. 
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Recharging">Recharging</span></h5>
<p>Most <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power point</a> storage devices allow psionic characters to “recharge” the item with their own <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a>. Doing this depletes the character’s <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power point</a> reserve on a 1-for-1 basis as if he had manifested a power; however, those <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> remain indefinitely stored. The opposite is not true—psionic characters may not use <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> stored in a storage item to replenish their own <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power point</a> reserves.
