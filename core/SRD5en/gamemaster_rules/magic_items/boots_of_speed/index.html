<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em> </p>
<p>While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action and click the boots' heels together. If you do, the boots double your walking speed, and any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.  <br/>
When the boots' property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function until you finish a long rest. </p></div>
