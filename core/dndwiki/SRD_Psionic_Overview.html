<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Psionic_Overview">Psionic Overview</span></h1>
<p>Psionic <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> spring from sentient minds. Even an <a href="SRD_Undead_Type.html" title="SRD:Undead Type">undead</a> creature or a being that has no physical form can create a reserve of inner strength necessary to manifest <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, as long as it has an <a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Intelligence</a> score of at least 1. <a href="SRD_Vermin_Type.html" title="SRD:Vermin Type">Vermin</a> possessed of a hive mind ability are an exception to this rule.
</p><p>A psionic power is a one-time psionic effect. Psionic characters and creatures need not prepare their <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> for use ahead of time. They either have sufficient <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> to manifest a power or they do not.
</p><p>A power is manifested when a psionic character pays its <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power point</a> cost. Some psionic creatures automatically manifest <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, called <a href="SRD_Psi-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Psi-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">psi-like abilities</a>, without paying a <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power point</a> cost. Other creatures pay <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> to manifest their <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, just as characters do.
</p><p>Each power has a specific effect. A power known to a psionic character can be used whenever he or she has <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> to pay for it.
</p><p>First you must choose which power to manifest. You can select any power you know, provided you are capable of manifesting <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> of that level or higher. To manifest a power, you must pay <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a>, which count against your daily total. You can manifest the same power multiple times if you have points left to pay for it.
