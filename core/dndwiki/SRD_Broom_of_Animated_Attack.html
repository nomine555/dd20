<p><b>Broom of Animated Attack:</b> This item is indistinguishable in appearance from a normal broom. It is identical to a <i><a href="SRD_Broom_of_Flying.html" title="SRD:Broom of Flying">broom of flying</a> </i>by all tests short of attempted use.
</p><p>If a command is spoken, the broom does a loop-the-loop with its hopeful rider, dumping him on his head from 1d4+5 feet off the ground (no falling damage, since the fall is less than 10 feet). The broom then attacks the victim, swatting the face with the straw or twig end and beating him with the handle end.
</p><p>The broom gets two attacks per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> with each end (two swats with the straw and two with the handle, for a total of four attacks per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>). It attacks with a +5 bonus on each <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack roll</a>. The straw end causes a victim to be <a href="SRD_Blinded.html" title="SRD:Blinded">blinded</a> for 1 <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> when it hits. The handle deals 1d6 points of damage when it hits. The broom has <a href="SRD_AC.html" title="SRD:AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a> 13, 18 <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>, and hardness 4.
