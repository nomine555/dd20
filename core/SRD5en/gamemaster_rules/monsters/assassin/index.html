<p><strong>Assassinate.</strong> During its first turn, the assassin has <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a> on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the assassin scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.  <br/>
<strong>Evasion.</strong> If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.  <br/>
<strong>Sneak Attack.</strong> Once per turn, the assassin deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a> on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the assassin that isn't <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Incapacitated</a> and the assassin doesn't have <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> on the attack roll. </p>
