<strong>Siege Monster.</strong> The treant deals double damage to objects and structures.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> The treant makes two slam attacks.  <br/>
<strong>Slam.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. <br/>
<strong>Rock.</strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage. <br/>
<strong>Animate Trees (1/Day).</strong> The treant magically animates one or two trees it can see within 60 feet of it. These trees have the same statistics as a treant, except they have <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/intelligence/index.html">Intelligence</a> and <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/charisma/index.html">Charisma</a> scores of 1, they can't speak, and they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the treant. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible.</p></div>
