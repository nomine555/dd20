# WELCOME, ADVENTURER
You have in your hands a **Tabletop RPG** adventure designed to be mastered from a tablet.
This is a medieval-fantasy adventure that uses *SRD5 System* and can be adapted to any game world.

## What is a roleplaying game?
Roleplaying games consist of taking on roles, usually in fantasy worlds. You have to imagine how your adventurer would face the challenges presented by the game’s director. You play sitting around a table with your friends, with a few dice and ready to have a good time.

## What do I need to play?
To play this adventure, you need to be familiarized with the *SRD5 System* and have dice and a pencil and paper. **The adventure itself gives you the necessary rules to resolve each encounter**. You will also need character sheets.

You can learn [how to run the game](./index.html?param=@running-the-adventure), read a [synopsis of the adventure](./index.html?param=@summary) or go directly to [[A mission in the tavern]].

## How does GameThrough work?
*GameThrough* divides the adventure’s content into encounters and scenes. The difference between encounters and scenes is only from the point of view of the story. In the encounters, a concrete situation is resolved - for example, a battle or an investigation - while the scenes describe more open-ended situations, such as exploring a city. Encounters and scenes are linked depending on players’ decisions. In the bottom left you will always find the *GameThrough* menu.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/summary/gamethrough.jpg&quot; class=&quot;icons-center&quot;&gt;

### Encounters and Scenes
On the left, you will have three tabs (At a glance, Body, Conclusion) and the icons with illustrations, maps, enemies and music.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/summary/gamethrough-2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;icons-center&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* **At a  glance**, describes what the characters can see in the encounter, using their skills.

* **Body**, is the default tab with links to illustrations, enemies, maps and music.

* **Conclusion**, describes the consequences of the characters’ actions. 

* On the right, you will find the text for the encounter or scene. 

### GameThrough Bar
The *GameThrough* bar offers four indexes so you can move around in the adventure. Each index corresponds to one of the following icons:
&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-1.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to the adventure’s classic index.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-2.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to a map with all the adventure’s locations &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-3.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to a list of all the non-player characters relevant to the adventure. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-4.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to a time diagram of the adventure. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-izquierda.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-derecha.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; With these icons, you will be able to navigate around the encounters you have already visited. &lt;/div&gt;

### Indexed rules
All the rules you need to resolve the adventure’s situations will appear on the left-hand side of the screen when you click on one of the [red links](#) or on *italics*.

# SUMMARY

&quot;Kidnap at Brookmili&quot; is an adventure for level 1 characters with the sole purpose of showing the structure of an adventure using *GameThrough*. It consists of three parts:
*A quest in the tavern*: The characters arrive in Brookmili and learn about the disappearance of the druid&#39;s daughter.
*Searching for the cave*: Looking for the goblin&#39;s lair, the group of heroes is attacked by a wolf pack.
*The goblin&#39;s cave*: The heroes must defeat the goblin tribe that has captured Vaeria.

# SOCIAL SCENE (100 PX)
&gt; When you arrive in Brookmili the chimneys of the huts have already started to smoke, but the lights of the inn &quot;The miner&#39;s shelter&quot; are still on.

The characters arrive already at night, and they will only find that they are attended to in the inn. *Maroun* has already retired to sleep and *Loulog* is at the inn cursing his life.

## The miner&#39;s refuge
&gt; The inn, once the source of song and laughter, is when you enter it dominated by an uncomfortable stillness. By the fireplace, an old man with a grey beard stares at a bowl of cold stew.

The man is *Loulog*, the druid. He has lost his daughter Vaeria. He suspects that there is a tribe of goblins in the area since, before he lost her, he saw one of them, and those creatures never go alone.  

He will appeal to the good hearts of the characters to go in search of her but if that is not enough, he will offer them a *Medallion of Animal Servitude* if they will take her back.  




AT A GLANCE
---
* Detect magic *:
 * Some of the objects carried by *Loulog* are magic (besides the *Medallion of Animal Servitude*).
* *Detecting good and evil*
 * There are no aberrations, celestial, elemental, fey, demons or undead.
 * There are no consecrated or magically desecrated objects.

CONCLUSION
---
Once the heroes talk to *Loulog*, they&#39;ll have to find their daughter&#39;s whereabouts in [[Searching for the cave]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Searching for the cave" tags="encounter flow" position="676,163" size="100,100">

# EXPLORATION SCENE (150 PX)
* 4x *Wolf*  

Finding the goblin settlement is not difficult if you know where to look. They have used a natural cave located south of Brookmili which, given its proximity, has made the village the immediate target of their actions.  

The unsuccessful search for the goblins by *Maroun* and the fact that *Loulog* has neglected his duties as a druid in the area, has brought a group of wolves closer than they should be to the area. As soon as the characters approach the southern area, they will ambush the group.  

## Hitting the cave
Finding the cave requires a test of *Wisdom* (Perception) or *Intelligence* (Investigation) CD 12.


AT A GLANCE
---
A test of *Wisdom* (Perception) CD 14 will prevent surprise in the attack of wolves.  
 * There are no aberrations, celestial, elemental, fey, demons or undead.
 * There are no consecrated or magically desecrated objects.

CONCLUSION
---
Regardless of which side they choose, the characters have the opportunity to claim their freedom in [[The Goblin Cave]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="The Goblin Cave" tags="encounter flow" position="1010,177" size="100,100">

# EXPLORATION / COMBAT SCENE
&gt;* **GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CAVE**
&gt;* The cave is 5 feet high in the corridors, and 15 feet high in the rooms. It is in total darkness so unless characters carry some source of light, their attack tests will be performed at a disadvantage and they will be attacked at an advantage.  

AT A GLANCE
---
* To detect magic *:
 * There&#39;s nothing magical.
* Detecting traps:
 * No traps in place.
* Detecting good and evil *
 * No aberrations, celestial, elemental, ugly, demons or living dead.
 * There are no consecrated or magically desecrated objects.

CONCLUSION
---
After exploring the cave, the heroes will find Vaeria in the [[Main Room]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Cave Map" tags="@cave-map" position="553,353" size="100,100">

# Guard room &lt;!--45,75--&gt;
* 3x *Goblin*  

Hidden among the stalactites, three goblins stalk the one who dares to enter their lair. They will wait in hiding until the visitors have passed through the middle of the room.

# Sets of lights &lt;!--77,45--&gt;
The lights that fall through the holes in the cave ceiling form bundles like columns, which confuse and hide the stalactites and stalagmites. Passing through this room requires passing a Save test *Wisdom* CD 13 or exiting where you have entered.

&gt; A strong stench of sweat and food floods the unventilated place. In the cave, several goblins play tavern games while others eat, sitting by the lake. At one end, all the possessions are piled up with the mats, made of rotten grass and untanned animal skins.  

Continues at [[Main Room]].  

# Treasure Hideout &lt;!--25,15--&gt;

# COMBAT (150 PX)
* 5x *Goblin*  
* *Goblin King*  

&gt; A strong stench of sweat and food floods the unventilated place. In the cave, several goblins play tavern games while others eat, sitting by the lake. In the background, a middle-aged woman struggles to bring some order to a pile of possessions piled up next to the pallets of rotten grass and untanned animal skins.  

The goblins will attack the characters on sight. He uses his passive perception to see if they&#39;re detected.  

The *Goblin King* will lead the attack and fight to the death. Not so his minions, who, if they see defeat imminent, will use the *Nimble Escape* to get out of there alive.

### Pit Trap
There&#39;s a badly disguised moat trap at the entrance to the cave. If it is not detected (Passive perception 12 or more) a character falling into it must perform a *Dexterity* test or fall into a small pit, losing 4 (1d6) hit points.


AT A GLANCE
---
* *Intelligence* (Investigation) CD 14:
 * There&#39;s a secret underwater tunnel that leads to the treasure hideout (see map).
* *Detect magic*:
 * There is nothing magical.
* *Detect traps*:
 * There&#39;s a pit trap at the entrance to the grotto.
* Detect good and evil:
 * There are no aberrations, celestial, elemental, fey, demons or undead.
 * There are no consecrated or magically desecrated objects.

Once the goblins are finished or made to flee, the reward awaits the heroes in [[Conclusion]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Conclusion" tags="flow" position="1250,554" size="100,100">
# CONCLUSION
Once the characters are done with the goblin threat and take their father back to Vaeria, they will be welcomed as heroes in the village, a party will be held and a statue will be erected in the middle of the square to remember the adventurers.  

In addition, the *Loulog* the druid will reward them with the *Medallion of Animal Servitude* whether he had offered it to them in the first scene or not.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
