<p><em>Potion, rare</em> </p>
<p>When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" effect of the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/enlargereduce/index.html">Enlarge/Reduce</a></em></strong> spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.</p></div>
