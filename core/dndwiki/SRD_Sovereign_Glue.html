<p><b>Sovereign Glue:</b> This pale amber substance is thick and viscous. Because of its particular <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, it can be contained only in a flask whose inside has been coated with 1 ounce of <i><a href="SRD_Salve_of_Slipperiness.html" title="SRD:Salve of Slipperiness">salve of slipperiness</a></i>, and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the flask, a new application of the <i>salve of slipperiness </i>must be put in the flask within 1 <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> to prevent the remaining glue from adhering to the side of the container. A flask of <i>sovereign glue, </i>when found, holds anywhere from 1 to 7 ounces of the stuff (1d8–1, minimum 1), with the other ounce of the flask’s capacity taken up by the <i>salve of slipperiness. </i>One ounce of this adhesive covers 1 square foot of surface, bonding virtually any two substances together in a permanent union. The glue takes 1 <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> to set. If the objects are pulled apart (a <a href="SRD_Move_Actions.html" title="SRD:Move Actions">move action</a>) before that time has elapsed, that application of the glue loses its stickiness and is worthless. If the glue is allowed to set, then attempting to separate the two bonded objects has no effect, except when <i><a href="SRD_Universal_Solvent.html" title="SRD:Universal Solvent">universal solvent</a> </i>is applied to the bond. (<i>Sovereign glue </i>is dissolved by <i>universal solvent.</i>)
