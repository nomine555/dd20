<p>You can create slender crystal wands called <a href="SRD_Dorjes.html" title="SRD:Dorjes">dorjes</a> than manifest <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> when charges are expended.

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Benefit">Benefit</span></h5>
<p>You can create a dorje of any psionic power you know (barring exceptions, such as <i><a href="SRD_Bestow_Power.html" title="SRD:Bestow Power">bestow power</a></i>, as noted in a powerâ€™s description). Crafting a dorje takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a dorje is its <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a> &#215; the power level &#215; 750 gp. To craft a dorje, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.
</p><p>A newly created dorje has 50 charges.
</p><p>Any dorje that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the XP cost derived from the base price, you must pay fifty times the XP cost.
