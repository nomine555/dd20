<p>You and any creature you touch are drawn along a crystal arc of reverie to the edge of conscious thought and into the region of dreams. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but each one must be touching another one. You physically enter the land of dreams, leaving nothing behind.
</p><p>In the region of dreams, you move through a menagerie of thoughts, desires, and phantoms created by the minds of dreamers everywhere. For every minute you move through dream, you can “wake” to find yourself five miles displaced in the waking world. Thus, a character can use this power to travel rapidly by physically entering where only dreams normally prowl, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back into the waking world. You know where you will come out in the waking world.
</p><p><i>Dream travel </i>can also be used to travel to other planes that contain creatures that dream, but doing this requires crossing into the dreams of <a href="SRD_Outsider_Type.html" title="SRD:Outsider Type">outsiders</a>, where you are subject to the vagaries of many dream realities—a potentially perilous proposition. Transferring to another plane of existence in this fashion requires 1d4 hours of uninterrupted travel.
</p><p>Any creatures that come along when <i>dream travel </i>is manifested also make the transition to the borders of unconscious thought. A creature separated from you wanders off into the dreamscape. When the duration ends, all affected creatures return to the waking world as much as 1,000 miles (d%x10) from their starting point. If a creature remains in the dreamscape, it is powerless to leave unless it can manifest the <i>dream travel </i>power itself or someone who manifests the power seeks out the lost creature.
