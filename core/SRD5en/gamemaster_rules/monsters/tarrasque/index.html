<strong>Challenge</strong> 30 (155,000 XP)   </p>
<p><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</strong> If the tarrasque fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. <br/>
<strong>Magic Resistance.</strong> The tarrasque has <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a> on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. <br/>
<strong>Reflective Carapace.</strong> Any time the tarrasque is targeted by a <strong><em>magic missle</em></strong> spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the tarrasque is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the tarrasque, turning the caster into the target. <br/>
<strong>Siege Monster.</strong> The tarrasque deals double damage to objects and structures.   </p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> The tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and one with its tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite. <br/>
<strong>Bite.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Grappled</a> (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a>, and the tarrasque can't bite another target. <br/>
<strong>Claw.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +19 to hit, reach 15ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage. <br/>
<strong>Horns.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +19 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 32 (4d10 + 10) piercing damage. <br/>
<strong>Tail.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +19 to hit, reach 20ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 24 (4d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> saving throw or be knocked <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Prone</a>. <br/>
<strong>Frightful Presence.</strong> Each creature of the tarrasque's choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> saving throw or become <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Frightened</a> for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> if the tarrasque is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. <br/>
<strong>Swallow.</strong> The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Blinded</a> and <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a>, it has total <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/combat/cover/index.html">Cover</a> against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque's turns.  <br/>
If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Prone</a> in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a> by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Prone</a>.   </p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The tarrasque can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The tarrasque regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<p><strong>Attack.</strong> The tarrasque makes one claw attack or tail attack.  <br/>
<strong>Move.</strong> The tarrasque moves up to half its speed.  <br/>
<strong>Chomp (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The tarrasque makes one bite attack or uses its Swallow. </p></div>
