# SPICES AND FLESH

*Islands of Plunder: Spices and Flesh* is an island-based adventure for
four 4th-level characters. It fits ideally when the PCs have a ship that
they can sail the high seas on, whether they own their own ship or have
already gained the use of one from a friendly sea captain.

# Background

Recently the seas surrounding the port city of Makemba have been plagued
by a pirate ship trying to pass themselves off as merchant vessels in
distress and then attacking those who try to render assistance. Ships
sailing into and out of the port city have taken to hiring more guards
than usual and some have even taken the controversial choice of not
rendering aid to vessels they come across.

The Makemban authorities have reacted by offering a 2,000 gp bounty for
any pirate or slaver ships found in the region. Those in good standing
or those who lodge a 500 gp bond with the Makemban authorities (to be
returned in one year&#39;s time so long as no complaints of wrongdoing are
lodged against the party) have been obtaining a writ from the Makemban
authorities. This writ authorizes the bearers to board any vessel flying
the flag of Makemba in order to search for evidence of slavery or
piracy.

This adventure assumes that the PCs have such a writ and have secured a
vessel for the express purpose of finding the pirates. If the PCs are
pirates themselves then this adventure can easily be changed to cater to
a of pirates who do not care about the plight of the ships sailing into
and out of Makemba.

### Where is Makemba?

Makemba can be anywhere that you need it to be. Changing the name from
Makemba is a nice easy change that allows you to use this adventure
wherever your PCs happen to be so long as they are in a coastal region.

&gt;* A life spent at sea is a life of adventure even in the real world, and
in a fantasy campaign a voyage beyond the horizon brings dangers and
wonders undreamed of by those that never venture out of sight of land.
Of course, &quot;Here there be monsters&quot; is more than just a scrawled note on
a fragment of map when you sail the seven seas. However, the beauty of a
nautical campaign is also the way that every island you visit and every
stretch of open water in between can become its own unique location for
adventure. You&#39;re not camping out in town and heading down to the local
dungeon; you are setting sail on the lookout for long-buried riches,
keeping a weather eye on the horizon for the danger you know is coming.
&gt;* The *Islands of Plunder* series is designed to populate that ocean with
adventure! Superstar author Matt Goodall brings you a succession of
adventures that you can drop into any seagoing campaign to enliven the
action in a way no random encounter ever could. These may serve as ideal
side-treks during a longer campaign or can serve as standalone
adventures on their own, with innovative encounters and exotic locales
that will leave your players relishing the discovery of the next
treasure map that might lead them onward toward the horizon. We hope
they spice up your nautical campaign with the rich story and background,
innovative layout, beautiful aesthetics, and excellence in design that
is the hallmark of Legendary Games. We hope you enjoy using it as much
as we enjoyed making it. Game on!

# CHASING / SOCIAL SCENE 

Read the following to the players:
 
&gt; Another vessel appears in the distance. A cargo ship which, from the
look of her, has seen much better days. She moves sluggishly along,
sitting low in the water, her hull scarred with old scuffs and
scratches, her paint worn and faded, and her sails covered in patches. A
tarnished nameplate labels her the “*Tamarind*”.

At first glance, the *Tamarind* appears to be a cargo ship with a small
crew, carrying a load of low to mediocre quality spices. The *Tamarind*
looks like the vague description of the pirate ship. However it is not
flying the flag of Makemba and so the PCs have no legal authority to
board the vessel. If they do not try to follow or board the *Tamarind*
then they should find it in the same region within the next day or two.
After a couple such sightings the *Tamarind* should definitely raise the
suspicion of the PCs. If it becomes clear the PCs are not going to
engage the *Tamarind* then the next time they see the ship the crew can
be pretending to be in distress so they can then attack any vessel that
tries to render assistance. In this case *Captain Craw* leads the first
wave of five pirates with his first mate, Sito, leading five more
pirates in the second wave in the following round. 5 crew remain behind
on the Tamarind. Otherwise the *Tamarind* will try to flee.

Should the PCs approach the *Tamarind* under the guise of friendship,
truce, or legitimate circumstances, the *Tamarin&#39;s* captain gives the
order to heave to without delay, and invites the party aboard.

Her captain, a man named Bartholomew Craw, seems an amiable fellow more
interested in parley than battling on the high seas. When the PCs board,
they find him to be a cordial and gracious host who hopes to negotiate a
peaceful solution over drinks and perhaps a fine meal.

### The Truth
The truth, however, is much different. *Captain Craw* is actually a
vicious slaver and the *Tamarind* has a secret hold, hidden beneath the
first, filled with shackled prisoners. While all of Craw&#39;s crew are
slavers, it is Sito Ripplepott, the ship&#39;s gnomish cook, who serves as
the captain&#39;s main accomplice. Sito is a *Poisons* expert who uses his
nefarious craft to keep the sentient cargo docile during the journey.

## Ship Chase
If the PCs look threatening in any way or do not declare why they are
moving closer to the *Tamarind*, she immediately attempts to flee upon
the crew spotting the PCs’ ship. If the PCs bring their ship directly
behind the *Tamarind*, *Captain Craw* orders the crew to use the light
ballista on board but only for a few shots to hopefully disable some of
the PCs’ ship’s rigging before making escape the primary focus again (+6
attack; 3d10 damage). The PCs’ ship can sustain a number of these
attacks but if it takes too much damage, the captain will start
objecting and talk about pulling back from the chase.

You can handle the ship chase as a series of ability checks. PCs who are
proficient in vehicles (water) can add their proficiency bonus to these
checks (the Tamarind&#39;s bonus is equal to +4). The *Tamarind* should
begin with a head start (up to 3 successful checks ahead of the PCs) and
then make a series of opposed checks. Once the PCs have had a number of
successes equal or greater than the *Tamarind,* they have successfully
caught up to the *Tamarind* and the crew of the *Tamarind* surrenders.
If the chase is dragging on and it becomes apparent to *Captain Craw* of
the *Tamarind* that the PCs aren&#39;t going to fall behind then they also
surrender and stop trying to get away.

If the PCs communicate to the *Tamarind* that they simply want to board
to have a discussion or search for signs of piracy or slavery, then the
crew also ceases trying to get away. In this case, skip ahead to the
parley section.

## Surrender
Upon boarding the *Tamarind*, the PCs find *Captain Craw* waiting for them
on deck. He immediately offers his scimitar to the PCs as an official
surrender. Likewise, his crew place their various weapons on the deck.
Captain Bartholomew Craw introduces himself, then apologizes for any
attempt to flee, and any shots from the *Tamarind*’s ballista; he
explains that this was because of the rumors of piracy in the region.

### The Truth
The surrendered weapons are a distraction. Each crew
member of the *Tamarind* has a light melee weapon concealed somewhere on
their person, ready to be drawn if they receive the signal to attack.
*Captain Craw* cast *protection from poison* and also drank a *potion of
disguise self* just before the PCs boarded, not to change his
appearance, but to allow him to conceal his magical scimitar. If the PCs
cast *detect magic* and notice an aura of magic around Craw, he smiles
ingratiatingly and says that he knows a few minor magic tricks,
including one that protects him from attacks in the event that he is
boarded. After identifying the auras of abjuration and illusion on Craw,
suspicious PCs who attempt to figure out exactly what spell it is can
make a DC 10 *Intelligence* (Arcana) check to realize that while
abjuration makes sense, there should be a visible effect if *Craw* had a
defensive illusion spell.

&gt;* **Potion of *Disguise Self* (uncommon)**. You gain the benefit of the
*disguise self* spell for 1 hour.

## Parley
Craw is most hospitable and once the PCs are below decks in the galley,
Sito serves everyone a stiff drink of heavily spiced grog before
returning to his kitchen duties. *Craw* begins by toasting the PCs before
leading them to the hold and expressing his regrets for the low-quality
of his cargo. If the PCs are here to inspect Craw&#39;s ship, despite not
having a Makemban flag, *Craw* is happy for the PCs to look around. If
Craw is under the impression that the PCs are here to take his cargo, he
tries to persuade them that while they could take his cargo, it’s barely
worth the effort of transferring it to the PCs’ ship, and will only take
up space in their hold that they could fill with much more valuable
plunder. *Craw* attempts to convince the PCs to release his ship instead.
To help sway them, Craw offers to help the PCs by putting the PCs in
touch with some of his contacts in the black market that could either
sell some goods, particularly magic items, with no questions asked or to
allow them to potentially purchase some magic items from a limited
amount.

If the PCs boarded the *Tamarind* under false pretenses, *Captain Craw*
still invites them below—only the conversation is one of friendly small
talk, the swapping of the latest news and information, and perhaps an
offer to sell some of the *Tamarind*’s spices.

### The Truth
If the PCs came aboard under false pretenses then Sito&#39;s
grog is *Poisoned* and each PC who drinks is exposed to a dose of elfbane
(Ingested. One minute after a creature has become subjected to this
poison they must succeed on a DC 15 *Constitution* saving throw or become
*Poisoned* and *Unconscious* for 1d3 hours). Before the PCs boarded the
*Tamarind*, *Craw* cast *protection from poison*, so he can imbibe the
poisoned brew and gain *Advantage* on his saving throw against being
*Poisoned*. The rest of the conversation is simply Craw&#39;s way of stalling
for time to let the poison do its work.

If the PCs boarded and captured the *Tamarind* then *Craw* expects that
the wary PCs are unlikely to fall for the poisoned grog ruse. He still
has *Sito* offer grog (that isn’t poisoned) and watches to see if the PCs
cast spells on their drinks before imbibing them. When in the cargo
hold, *Craw* pretends to act slightly nervous and his eyes seem to
repeatedly wander to a section of the hull on the port side next to the
ladder, 10 feet round from the ship’s bow.
* PCs who make a successful DC
10 *Wisdom* (Insight) check notice *Captain Craw* doing this, but PCs whose
check result also beats Craw’s opposed *Charisma* (Deception) check
realize that *Craw* is purposefully acting in this way, deliberately
trying to draw their attention to that area rather than unintentionally
revealing it.  
* A successful DC 10 *Wisdom* (Perception) check while
searching that area reveals a small hidden compartment set against the
hull. Resting in a nest of straw inside the compartment is a set of
three oily clay vials. The vials contain a *potion of hill giant
strength*, a *potion of healing*, a *potion of acid resistance*, and a
small amount of saffron oil (worth 60 gp). Normally these potions are in
Sito’s possession and the valuable saffron oil secured away in Craw’s
sea chest. All the vials are covered in a contact poison version of
elfbane; anyone who touches these vials is exposed to the poison. The
lid of the vial of saffron oil is loose, making it appear as if it has
leaked over the other vials. *Craw* feigns disappointed when the PCs
discover this cache, but secretly hopes the PCs pass these treasures
around as they try to identify them.  
* A successful DC 15 *Intelligence* (Nature) check (characters proficient in alchemist&#39;s supplies may add
their proficiency bonus to this check) reveals the toxic *Nature* of the
oily coating on the vials. Avoid having the PCs rolls saving throws as
soon as they touch a poisoned vial. Secretly track which PCs have
touched the vials, keeping note of how often each PC is in contact with
a vial, as there may be multiple exposures. Have the PCs make saving
throws retroactively when they become aware of the poison, or at the end
of the 1 minute onset period when some of them may start succumbing to
the poison. This curtails any metagaming, and increases the chances of
the vials being passed to different party members.

## Clues

The following suggestions are some ways that the PCs can start to learn
that not all onboard the *Tamarind* is as it seems:

• A DC 15 *Intelligence* (Investigation) check, after seeing the cargo in
the hold: the ship is sitting too low in the water for the amount of
cargo in the hold. If the PCs mention this, *Craw* says that he has a
large load of ballast to keep the *Tamarind* from capsizing in the
frequent storms that strike this area of ocean and that the ship’s hull
has a multitude of small leaks, meaning the ship usually carries a lot
of bilgewater.

• A DC 10 *Intelligence* (Investigation) check, after seeing the size of
the cargo hold: the cargo hold is small for a ship this size. If
questioned about this, *Craw* simply points out that while the *Tamarind*
isn’t the most efficiently or elegantly built ship on the ocean, she is
very sturdy. Craw says that the ship’s extra structural supports means
he can’t carry quite as much cargo but it does mean the *Tamarind* is a
lot more likely to arrive in port in one piece.

• A DC 10 *Wisdom* (Perception) or *Intelligence* (Investigation) check
after watching Sito preparing food in the galley: Ripplepott is making
two separate meals. One is a regular ship&#39;s dinner while the other is a
large pot of simple gruel. If the PCs draw attention to this, Craw
mentions that he’s a fair but firm captain and one of the more common
punishments he metes out for disciplinary infractions is putting
crewmembers on gruel rations for at least a week.

• A DC 10 *Wisdom* (Perception) or *Intelligence* (Investigation) check
while examining the spices in the hold: many of the containers of spice
in the far corners of the cargo hold are old and dusty. Only those in
the easiest to reach places show signs of being new or recently moved.
If the PCs call *Craw* on this, he sighs and goes into a long discourse on
his recent string of misfortunes in the spice trade. He confides that
he’s hoping to sell his cargo as a job lot and get rid of the older
spices by mixing them in with his fresher stock.

• A DC 10 *Intelligence* (Investigation) check by a character with ranks
in the skill after seeing the galley: many of Ripplepott&#39;s bottles and
equipment in the galley are for crafting alchemical items rather than
food. If the check result beats the DC by 10 or more, then the PC
recognizes tools and materials for poison-making.

• A DC 15 *Wisdom* (Insight) check against crew members other than Captain
Craw or Sito Ripplepott: gives the sense that they are very
uncomfortable about the PCs being onboard.

• A DC 15 *Wisdom* (Perception) check while in the hold: beneath the
strong scent of spices in the cargo hold is the distinct smell of feces
and sweat. Any PC within 5 feet of the trap door leading to the secret
hold gets *Advantage* on this check.

• A successful opposed *Wisdom* (Perception) check by a PC contested
against a crewmember’s *Dexterity* (Sleight of Hand) check while closely
observing or searching a crew member: notices the presence of a hidden
weapon on that crewmember.

# INVESTIGATION SCENE

## Above Deck

**1. Upper Main Deck**: This area rises just over 4 feet above the main
deck. It holds the ship&#39;s steering wheel and its only armament—a light
ballista mounted off the stern. Two ladders, one on either side, connect
the platform with the main deck. On the main deck next to the port-side
ladder is a small door that leads to a storage space under the platform
that holds oars, spare planks, sails, tools, and other supplies.

**2. Main Deck**: The main deck of the *Tamarind* has a simple layout.
The mast is at the center of the ship and forward of it are large
loading doors that lead into the cargo hold below. A ladder near the
mast and another near the cargo hold both lead below deck.

**3. Crow’s Nest**: At the top of the mast is a simple, 5-foot square
platform that serves as a lookout point for the ship.

## Below Deck

**4. Captain&#39;s Quarters**: The private bunk of Captain Craw also serves
as his chart room and office. A comfortable cot and nightstand are in
one corner and maps, charts, and other navigational tools cover the
walls. There is also a small writing desk containing numerous logs and
record books detailing the captain&#39;s dealings—in both spices and slaves.
A thorough search of the cabin finds a weathered piece of parchment that
potentially leads to further adventure (see [Part 2: Delivering the Cargo](./index.html?param=@delivering-the-cargo)). Beside
the bed is a sea chest that contains his personal belongings. The door
to this room is always locked and Captain Craw carries the key with him
at all times.

**5. Cabin/Galley**: This main cabin is both the eating and sleeping
area for the rest of the crew. A large stained and dirty table with
matching benches takes up the center of the space while old hammocks and
personal effects are strung all around in a haphazard manner. On the
starboard side, a narrow section holds a small galley. Foodstuffs and
kitchen utensils mix seamlessly with Ripplepott&#39;s alchemical tools and
belongings in a bizarre-looking mess.

**6. Cargo Hold**: Crates, barrels, and sacks of various spices
partially fill the ship&#39;s hold. The dusty air is thick with the heavy
odor of spices. One of the large crates in the southeast section rests
on top of a secret trap door leading down into the secret hold below.
Finding this trap door requires the searching character to make a
successful DC 15 *Wisdom* (Perception) check.

**7. Secret Hold**: This space is only tall enough for a Medium-sized
creature to stand hunched over. Dozens of people lie chained to the
floor and walls with thick, iron manacles. Most are *Unconscious* and the
few who are awake are torpid. They are all in poor health and show all
the signs of being malnourished. The stench of sweat and human waste is
overpowering, made all the worse by the stale air.

AT A GLANCE
---
* *Intelligence* (Investigation) DC 15:
  * The ship is sitting too low in the water for the amount of cargo in the hold.
* *Wisdom* (Perception) or *Intelligence* (Investigation) DC 10:
  * Many of the containers of spice
in the far corners of the cargo hold are old and dusty.
* *Intelligence* (Investigation) DC 10:
  * Many of Ripplepott&#39;s bottles and
equipment in the galley are for crafting alchemical items rather than
food.
* *Wisdom* (Perception) DC 15:
  * Beneath the strong scent of spices in the cargo hold is the distinct smell of feces and sweat.

CONCLUSION
---
Sooner or later, players will notice they are being cheated, and it will start a [[Combat aboard!]].

creature may avert their eyes from the *Sea Hag* unless they are surprised
by the form. A creature gains *Disadvantage* on attack rolls against the
hag until the start of their next turn if they avert their eyes
## Actions
**Multiattack.** Shayonna can make two claw attacks as an action.  
**Claws.** melee 10 ft., 1 target. +8 to hit, 2d6+5 (13) slashing
damage. If the creature is medium or smaller than they are *Grappled* (DC
15 to escape) and *Restrained* until the grapple ends. Jorunea has two
claws and can grapple a single creature in each claw.  
**Salt Wife&#39;s Glare.** As an action against Shayonna can target a single
creature that is within 30 feet and *Frightened* of her. They must pass a
DC 15 *Wisdom* saving throw against this magical effect or be reduced to 0
HP. A creature affected by this ability becomes doesn&#39;t make death
saving throws and gains the ability to breathe underwater. While
underwater the creature cannot regain HP. After spending a day submersed
in water the creature must succeed at a DC 10 *Constitution* save or be
transformed into a *Merrow* and regain their HP. If transformed into a
*Merrow* they regard Shayonna as their beloved mistress. She gains
*Advantage* on *Charisma* (Deception) checks when interacting with the
*Merrow* she transforms, and they in turn become immune to her horrific
appearance. This transformation cannot be dispelled but can be reversed
with *remove curse*. This effect becomes permanent after seven days have
passed.  
**Illusory Appearance.** Jorunea can make herself appear as a medium
female humanoid. Creatures that touch Shayonna or make a successful DC
16 *Intelligence* (Investigation) check can successfully see through the
disguise.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Delivering the Cargo" tags="encounter @delivering-the-cargo" position="1056,356" size="100,100">
#  Part 2: Delivering the Cargo

Among the papers in Captain Craw’s cabin, the PCs find a piece of
weathered parchment containing a curious message and rough map. The
message contains an order for a consignment of slaves and instructions
for delivery of this shipment. The map marks the delivery location as a
point in the open ocean, with the nearest island over 20 miles away.
Scrawled on the parchment in Craw’s handwriting is the following: “This
be an odd trade run if ever there were one. I guess there’ll be a ship
waiting out there, but why not make the trade at an island instead?
Would have been much easier. Still if the pay is as good as that down
payment of pearls it’ll make the trip well worthwhile, even if it means
the risk of sailing through pirate-infested waters.” The only other clue
is in Craw’s ledgers from over 2 months ago. A note next to an entry
paying off a large debt reads, “Those pearls did the trick, that’ll keep
the legbreakers off me. It was good of old Jarkus the drunkard to put me
onto this deal. I don’t know why the ancient poxy lubber kept muttering
about it being “Shayonna’s debt”. I don’t give a damn about the name of
whoever he gets any of these jobs from. Getting more of those lustrous
pearls is what I care about.”

While there is enough food and water to feed the rescued slaves for the
trip to the Islet and back, the rescued slaves would rather return to
port. If the PCs also sail back to port they risk missing the rendezvous
time. They could try to put the pirates to work (although face potential
mutiny) or sail themselves (in which case you can simply hand wave it or
run the PCs through a series of ability checks varying from DC 5 to DC
15).

A successful DC 15 *Intelligence* (History) check reveals the name
‘Shayonna’ is part of a tragic Ghost story told by sailors in many
ports.  
[The Legend of Shayonna](../lugares.html?param=@the-legend-of-shayonna&amp;room=0)

&gt;* **Making DEADLY Dramatic!**
&gt;* Normally, a writer using up valuable word count on an NPC’s background
that the PCs may never learn isn’t a good idea. However, the Gaunt is a
deadly *Sea Hag*. Even in a short adventure like this one, the PCs should
be aware that they face something ominous and terrifying. If the PCs
defeat her and live to tell the tale, they automatically gain renown
with the other sailors in the area when they next make port and speak of
this deed. If you are using *inspiration* in your campaign you should
award one inspiration to all of the PCs that actively participated in
the defeat of Shayonna. If some of the PCs were particularly heroic but
already have inspiration (the usual maximum), you might want to consider
a one off temporary suspension of this limit and award them an
inspiration to temporarily give them a total of two inspiration. Once
one of these two inspirations is used the maximum reverts to the usual
one inspiration.


Assuming the account of the valuable pearls strikes the PCs’ interest,
it takes less than a week of travel to reach the location marked on the
map. It is a tiny islet, sandy and barren, surrounded by a large coral
reef. The shallow waters and jagged reefs around this speck of land mean
that the PCs’ ship needs to moor at least 300 feet away to avoid damage
to the hull. There is, however, no one on the isle and no other ships in
sight.

## Reception
* *Shayonna the Gaunt*
* 2x *Merrow*  
  
Shortly after the PCs land on the islet, a pair of
hulking, brutish things put their heads above the surface of the sea
nearby and warily wade toward the PCs. These are a pair of *Merrow* , the
unholy offspring of the legendary Sea Hag, *Shayonna the Gaunt*. They
approach the islet from the east, using the shallow water for *Cover* and,
providing the PCs don’t attack, slowly emerging from the water. Both
creatures have the waterlogged remnants of sailor’s outfits still
clinging to their gross forms. One of them speaks in gurgling, barely
understandable Common asking why the PCs have come. If the PCs provide a
believable reason to be here, such as to sell slaves, the *Merrows* nod
and one dives into the water to convey this information to Shayonna.
Shayonna is already aware of the presence of the PCs’ ship and has sent
her minions to ascertain their intentions if a party comes ashore.

The remaining *Merrow* has a deep scar across the right side of its face
that cuts off the lower half of its right ear. The curious thing is a
piece of silver jewelry crafted to resemble the missing piece of flesh
dangles from two earrings in the upper half of this ear. PCs can
recognize this unusual jewelry and its owner with a DC 15 *Intelligence*
(Investigation) check. It belongs to a knavish scallywag named Gamin
‘half-ear’ Crystos, a womanizing half-elven pirate, popular in many
local ports for his willingness to spread his plunder around. Gamin lost
his ear from a close call with an imperial ballista bolt. If any of the
PCs have ever actually seen Gamin, the *Merrow* bears a warped, monstrous
resemblance to the man. If addressed by name, the *Merrow* stares blankly
at the PCs before a flicker of recognition crosses the creature’s face
and it burbles three words in Giant, “please kill me”. The grotesque
thing that was once a man then stiffens and comprehension fades from its
eyes, leaving only brutish hostility.

### Treasure
Gamin’s earring is only worth 50 gp, but it grants the PC
*Advantage* if they use it as part of a *Charisma* (Persuade) check on a
nautical NPC. The ring can only be used in this way once until it is old
news and no longer impresses sailors.

## Parley
If the PCs wait, after several minutes Shayonna the Gaunt 
rises up out of the ocean. She has used a disguise to conceal her
horrific form, appearing as a youthful aquatic humanoid, similar to a
merfolk, but with legs instead of a tail. Even in this unassuming form,
there is something palpably sinister in her manner. The ocean itself
seems to recoil from her and as she steps onto the sand; her blood-red
hair is dry. Flanked by her two *Merrows*, Shayonna approaches the PCs and asks what they have brought her. Shayonna cagily negotiates for the
consignment of slaves and shrewdly asks why the PCs are making this
delivery rather than the Captain Craw. Shayonna demands the PCs bring a
sample selection of slaves ashore for her to examine. She haggles over
the price and the quality of the merchandise but is prepared to pay up
to 2,800 gp in pearls for all the *Tamarind’s* slaves, regardless of
their condition, which is an exceptionally good price.

If the PCs sell the slaves, these poor wretches are brought ashore where
they huddle together on the tiny islet. Each day at dawn, shells full of
brackish water and raw fish are left on the shore to sustain them, and
each night one of the doomed slaves vanishes, as the unfortunate is
dragged below the waves to a ghastly fate. After completing such a
despicable bargain, the PCs had best be gone quickly and never return,
for when Shayonna has at least six *Merrows* in total under her
control, she avariciously boards any nearby vessel to gain additional
minions.

If players don&#39;t make a pack with Shayonna for the slaves, they can figure out where she hides and explore [[The Desolate Islet]].

AT A GLANCE
---
* *Intelligence* (History) DC 15:
 * The name ‘Shayonna’ is part of a tragic Ghost story told by sailors in many ports and reveals [The Legend of Shayonna](../lugares.html?param=@the-legend-of-shayonna&amp;room=0)  
* *Detect magic*:
 * There is nothing magical. 
* *Detect evil and good*:
 * There are not aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead creatures.
 * There are not places or objects that has been magically consecrated or desecrated. 

CONCLUSION

If players don&#39;t make a pack with Shayonna for the slaves, they can fight her and her minions at [[The Desolate Islet]].

## 1. Underwater Passage

Just to the south of the islet is an underwater tunnel into the coral
reef that leads through to Shayonna’s lair. The tunnel is marked with a
darker outline on the map; the other lighter areas are simply gaps
between the colonies of coral surrounding the islet. The thick coral
over the tunnel makes it impossible to spot from above and a steep
overhang above the tunnel entrance conceals it from the view of anyone
on the island. The passage slopes down from a depth of 5 feet at the
northern end to 25 feet at the southern end where it opens out into area 3. Scattered sunlight filters in during the day, providing dim
illumination; at night, the tunnel is in darkness. The Large-sized
*Merrows* need to squeeze through this tunnel which slows them
significantly.

## 2. Coralline Tunnel

**Coral Flensing Trap.** At the entrance of the Coralline tunnel is a
magical trap that triggers the second anyone that is of Small size or
larger, other than Shayonna or a *Merrow*, passes through this area.

A successful DC 20 *Intelligence* (Arcana) check to spot the Coralline
Flensing trap and another DC 20 *Intelligence* (Arcana) check to disable
it. When the trap triggers a torrent of water attempts to slam the
creature into the razor sharp corals that line the passage, dealing 1d8
piercing damage. This trap automatically resets and can trigger once per
round.

## 3. Urchin Cluster
* 3x *Ravenous Urchin Swarm tiny*
  
The coralline tunnel opens out into an underwater clearing. Multicolored
corals grow in profusion all around this open area, but there are gaps
in coral branches overhead, allowing more light through from above
(giving this area the same illumination level as above the waves) and
providing Medium or smaller creatures with a way up to the surface. The
area is 10 feet high and the seafloor is 25 feet below the surface.

The passage to the south narrows to a small shaft that leads up to the
outside of the reef. It requires a DC 15 *Dexterity* (Acrobatics) check
for Small- or Medium-sized creatures to squeeze along this shaft, larger
creatures can’t fit at all, and smaller creatures can move through
without restriction.

**Creatures**: While there are tiny fish swimming among the coral and
aquatic plant life, the main danger here is a large number of predatory
ravenous sea urchins. These spiny marine creatures are under Shayonna’s
sway and don’t attack her or her *Merrows*, but hungrily surge over
intruders.

## 4. Sea Hag’s Grotto (CR 6)
* *Shayonna the Gaunt*
* 3x *Ravenous Urchin Swarm medium*
  
&gt; A carpet of pale bones litters the seabed in this grotto of dead
skeletal coral. Sharp spikes of lifeless coral jut from the walls and
opposite the entrance, glistening pearls rest in several large
seashells. Curtains of lifeless blackened seaweed hang from the walls.

The thick coral blocks any light from the surface leaving the area in
darkness.

**Creature**: This dark grotto is the lair of Shayonna the Gaunt. Her
*Merrow* minions have likely already alerted her to the approach of the
PCs’ ship. Shayonna lurks here, patiently waiting for the PCs to bring
her the slaves she needs to complete her foul ministrations.

If she retreats here to her grotto after a fight on shore, she animates
her *claw of the briny depths* and waits for the PCs to arrive.

**Treasure**: The piles of silvery pearls are worth 3,200 gp in total.

&gt;* **Claw of the Briny Depths (uncommon).** The thick webbed membranes
between the withered digits of this severed claw hint at the subaquatic
origins of the thalassic thing it was once a part of. On command, the
claw animates as a clawing claw (as described in the official manual of
monsters for 5th Edition) with a *Swim* speed of 20 foot instead of a
*Climb* speed. This crawling claw is under the control of the creature who
animated it and lasts for 3 minutes before decomposing into a foul
nonmagical slurry of festering tissue and bones.


AT A GLANCE
---
* *Detect magic*:
 * The *Claw of the Briny Depths* (see box) is magical.
* *Detect evil and good*:
 * Shayonna is a fey, so she can be detected as usual under the range of the spell.
 * There are not places or objects that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.

# Concluding the Adventure

Once the PCs have dealt with the *Tamarind* and Shayonna the Gaunt in
one way or another, and likely gained a rich prize of pearls, they are
free to continue on with their adventures. If Shayonna the Gaunt
survives, PCs may encounter her again, perhaps as the captain of a ship
of her own crewed by a horde of monstrous Merrows.

# WELCOME, ADVENTURER
You have in your hands a **Tabletop RPG** adventure designed to be mastered from a tablet.
This is a medieval-fantasy adventure that uses *SRD5 System* and can be adapted to any game world.

## What is a roleplaying game?
Roleplaying games consist of taking on roles, usually in fantasy worlds. You have to imagine how your adventurer would face the challenges presented by the game’s director. You play sitting around a table with your friends, with a few dice and ready to have a good time.

## What do I need to play?
To play this adventure, you need to be familiarized with the *SRD5 System* and have dice and a pencil and paper. **The adventure itself gives you the necessary rules to resolve each encounter**. You will also need character sheets.

You can read a [synopsis of the adventure](./index.html?param=@resumen) or go directly to [[Easy Pickings]].

## How does GameThrough work?
*GameThrough* divides the adventure’s content into encounters and scenes. The difference between encounters and scenes is only from the point of view of the story. In the encounters, a concrete situation is resolved - for example, a battle or an investigation - while the scenes describe more open-ended situations, such as exploring a city. Encounters and scenes are linked depending on players’ decisions. In the bottom left you will always find the *GameThrough* menu.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/summary/gamethrough.jpg&quot; class=&quot;icons-center&quot;&gt;

### Encounters and Scenes
On the left, you will have three tabs (At a glance, Body, Conclusion) and the icons with illustrations, maps, enemies and music.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/summary/gamethrough-2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;icons-center&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* **At a  glance**, describes what the characters can see in the encounter, using their skills.

* **Body**, is the default tab with links to illustrations, enemies, maps and music.

* **Conclusion**, describes the consequences of the characters’ actions. 

* On the right, you will find the text for the encounter or scene. 

### GameThrough Bar
The *GameThrough* bar offers four indexes so you can move around in the adventure. Each index corresponds to one of the following icons:
&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-1.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to the adventure’s classic index.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-2.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to a map with all the adventure’s locations &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-3.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to a list of all the non-player characters relevant to the adventure. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-4.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to a time diagram of the adventure. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-izquierda.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-derecha.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; With these icons, you will be able to navigate around the encounters you have already visited. &lt;/div&gt;

### Indexed rules
All the rules you need to resolve the adventure’s situations will appear on the left-hand side of the screen when you click on one of the [red links](#) or on *italics*.

## CAPTAIN CRAW
![medium](./images/craw.jpg)
*Bartholomew Craw is a paunchy, heavy-set man wearing the dirty and
threadbare outfit of a merchant sea captain. His shaved head is
ruddily-sunburned and his squinting, deep-set eyes are dark brown. A
scraggly, dull-red beard only serves to make his wide smile, full of
yellowed teeth, all the more noticeable.*

**Horrific Appearance.** The sight of a *Sea Hag* is so revolting that
anyone within 30 feet (other than another hag) and can see what the hag
truly looks like must succeed on a DC 15 *Wisdom* saving throw or be
*Frightened* for 1 minute. A creature may make a new saving throw at the
end of each turn, ending the effect on a success. If the saving throw
succeeds the creature becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours. A
creature may avert their eyes from the *Sea Hag* unless they are surprised
by the form. A creature gains *Disadvantage* on attack rolls against the
hag until the start of their next turn if they avert their eyes
### Actions
**Multiattack.** Shayonna can make two claw attacks as an action.  
**Claws.** melee 10 ft., 1 target. +8 to hit, 2d6+5 (13) slashing
damage. If the creature is medium or smaller than they are *Grappled* (DC
15 to escape) and *Restrained* until the grapple ends. Jorunea has two
claws and can grapple a single creature in each claw.  
**Salt Wife&#39;s Glare.** As an action against Shayonna can target a single
creature that is within 30 feet and *Frightened* of her. They must pass a
DC 15 *Wisdom* saving throw against this magical effect or be reduced to 0
HP. A creature affected by this ability becomes doesn&#39;t make death
saving throws and gains the ability to breathe underwater. While
underwater the creature cannot regain HP. After spending a day submersed
in water the creature must succeed at a DC 10 *Constitution* save or be
transformed into a *Merrow* and regain their HP. If transformed into a
*Merrow* they regard Shayonna as their beloved mistress. She gains
*Advantage* on *Charisma* (Deception) checks when interacting with the
*Merrow* she transforms, and they in turn become immune to her horrific
appearance. This transformation cannot be dispelled but can be reversed
with *remove curse*. This effect becomes permanent after seven days have
passed.  
**Illusory Appearance.** Jorunea can make herself appear as a medium
female humanoid. Creatures that touch Shayonna or make a successful DC
16 *Intelligence* (Investigation) check can successfully see through the
disguise.

## SITO RIDDLEPOT

*With a hunch that makes him seem shorter than he already is, this gnome
dresses in simple clothes and a leather apron covered in grease and
other stains. His slick hair is the color of moss and his beady eyes are
a quiet gray. Slung around his waist is a bandoleer of flasks and
cooking utensils.*

# Upper Main Deck
This area rises just over 4 feet above the main
deck. It holds the ship&#39;s steering wheel and its only armament—a light
ballista mounted off the stern. Two ladders, one on either side, connect
the platform with the main deck. On the main deck next to the port-side
ladder is a small door that leads to a storage space under the platform
that holds oars, spare planks, sails, tools, and other supplies.

# Main Deck
The main deck of the *Tamarind* has a simple layout.
The mast is at the center of the ship and forward of it are large
loading doors that lead into the cargo hold below. A ladder near the
mast and another near the cargo hold both lead below deck.

# Crow’s Nest
At the top of the mast is a simple, 5-foot square
platform that serves as a lookout point for the ship.

# Captain&#39;s Quarters
The private bunk of Captain Craw also serves
as his chart room and office. A comfortable cot and nightstand are in
one corner and maps, charts, and other navigational tools cover the
walls. There is also a small writing desk containing numerous logs and
record books detailing the captain&#39;s dealings—in both spices and slaves.
A thorough search of the cabin finds a weathered piece of parchment that
potentially leads to further adventure (see [Part 2: Delivering the Cargo](./index.html?param=@delivering-the-cargo)). Beside
the bed is a sea chest that contains his personal belongings. The door
to this room is always locked and Captain Craw carries the key with him
at all times.

# Cabin/Galley
This main cabin is both the eating and sleeping
area for the rest of the crew. A large stained and dirty table with
matching benches takes up the center of the space while old hammocks and
personal effects are strung all around in a haphazard manner. On the
starboard side, a narrow section holds a small galley. Foodstuffs and
kitchen utensils mix seamlessly with Ripplepott&#39;s alchemical tools and
belongings in a bizarre-looking mess.

# Cargo Hold
Crates, barrels, and sacks of various spices
partially fill the ship&#39;s hold. The dusty air is thick with the heavy
odor of spices. One of the large crates in the southeast section rests
on top of a secret trap door leading down into the secret hold below.
Finding this trap door requires the searching character to make a
successful DC 15 *Wisdom* (Perception) check.

# Secret Hold
This space is only tall enough for a Medium-sized
creature to stand hunched over. Dozens of people lie chained to the
floor and walls with thick, iron manacles. Most are *Unconscious* and the
few who are awake are torpid. They are all in poor health and show all
the signs of being malnourished. The stench of sweat and human waste is
overpowering, made all the worse by the stale air.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Islet Map" tags="lugares @islet-map" position="1199,475" size="100,100">
# 1. Underwater Passage

Just to the south of the islet is an underwater tunnel into the coral
reef that leads through to Shayonna’s lair. The tunnel is marked with a
darker outline on the map; the other lighter areas are simply gaps
between the colonies of coral surrounding the islet. The thick coral
over the tunnel makes it impossible to spot from above and a steep
overhang above the tunnel entrance conceals it from the view of anyone
on the island. The passage slopes down from a depth of 5 feet at the
northern end to 25 feet at the southern end where it opens out into area 3. Scattered sunlight filters in during the day, providing dim
illumination; at night, the tunnel is in darkness. The Large-sized
*Merrows* need to squeeze through this tunnel which slows them
significantly.

# 2. Coralline Tunnel

**Coral Flensing Trap.** At the entrance of the Coralline tunnel is a
magical trap that triggers the second anyone that is of Small size or
larger, other than Shayonna or a *Merrow*, passes through this area.

A successful DC 20 *Intelligence* (Arcana) check to spot the Coralline
Flensing trap and another DC 20 *Intelligence* (Arcana) check to disable
it. When the trap triggers a torrent of water attempts to slam the
creature into the razor sharp corals that line the passage, dealing 1d8
piercing damage. This trap automatically resets and can trigger once per
round.

# 3. Urchin Cluster
* 3x *Ravenous Urchin Swarm tiny*  

The coralline tunnel opens out into an underwater clearing. Multicolored
corals grow in profusion all around this open area, but there are gaps
in coral branches overhead, allowing more light through from above
(giving this area the same illumination level as above the waves) and
providing Medium or smaller creatures with a way up to the surface. The
area is 10 feet high and the seafloor is 25 feet below the surface.

The passage to the south narrows to a small shaft that leads up to the
outside of the reef. It requires a DC 15 *Dexterity* (Acrobatics) check
for Small- or Medium-sized creatures to squeeze along this shaft, larger
creatures can’t fit at all, and smaller creatures can move through
without restriction.

**Creatures**: While there are tiny fish swimming among the coral and
aquatic plant life, the main danger here is a large number of predatory
ravenous sea urchins. These spiny marine creatures are under Shayonna’s
sway and don’t attack her or her *Merrows*, but hungrily surge over
intruders.


# 4. Sea Hag’s Grotto (CR 6)
* *Shayonna the Gaunt*
* 3x *Ravenous Urchin Swarm medium*

&gt; A carpet of pale bones litters the seabed in this grotto of dead
skeletal coral. Sharp spikes of lifeless coral jut from the walls and
opposite the entrance, glistening pearls rest in several large
seashells. Curtains of lifeless blackened seaweed hang from the walls.

The thick coral blocks any light from the surface leaving the area in
darkness.

**Creature**: This dark grotto is the lair of Shayonna the Gaunt. Her
*Merrow* minions have likely already alerted her to the approach of the
PCs’ ship. Shayonna lurks here, patiently waiting for the PCs to bring
her the slaves she needs to complete her foul ministrations.

If she retreats here to her grotto after a fight on shore, she animates
her *claw of the briny depths* and waits for the PCs to arrive.

**Treasure**: The piles of silvery pearls are worth 3,200 gp in total.

&gt;* **Claw of the Briny Depths (uncommon).** The thick webbed membranes
between the withered digits of this severed claw hint at the subaquatic
origins of the thalassic thing it was once a part of. On command, the
claw animates as a clawing claw (as described in the official manual of
monsters for 5th Edition) with a *Swim* speed of 20 foot instead of a
*Climb* speed. This crawling claw is under the control of the creature who
animated it and lasts for 3 minutes before decomposing into a foul
nonmagical slurry of festering tissue and bones.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Combat aboard!" tags="encounter @combat-aboard" position="907,354" size="100,100">
## Set Up
* *Bartholomew Craw*  
* *Ship’s Cook*  
* 15 *Sailors*
  
Captain Craw&#39;s plan of attack depends on how well the poison works
against the party. If none of the PCs succumb and they remain unaware of
the attempt, Craw keeps up the ruse, perhaps offering the PCs a fine
meal if they look weak or divided and he believes a second attempt at
poisoning might work. Otherwise, Craw simply lets the PCs take the
spices and leave. He also chooses this option if the PCs and their crew
obviously outnumber and outmatch his. Depending on their negotiations,
the PCs may encounter Craw again and make use of his services before
learning his true nature (if they ever do).

## Tactics
If some of the PCs succumb, or if none do but the PCs become aware of
the poisoning attempt, then Craw initiates combat. The Captain signals
his crew to draw their hidden weapons and attack the PCs’ crew. Sito
Ripplepott appears and harasses the party at range while Craw himself
wades into battle. If the PCs find the hidden trap door to the secret
hold before Craw has a chance to spring his trap, he lets one or two PCs
go down before attempting to separate the PCs by slamming the hatch shut
and signaling the attack. If the party won&#39;t split, he signals the
attack immediately.

If all the PCs fall *Unconscious* from the poison, they later wake to find
themselves stripped of gear and chained in the secret hold with the rest
of the slaves. They learn the truth of the *Tamarind* from a visit by
Sito, who brings gruel and water, and from Craw himself, who reveals his
true colors. They can also learn the fate of their ship and crew.
Perhaps a less trustworthy member of the PCs’ crew saw the opportunity
to become captain, or maybe Craw forced the PCs’ crew to withdraw by
threatening to kill the PCs, and their ship is still sailing nearby.
Ultimately, how the party escapes from this predicament is up to the
players&#39; ingenuity and your discretion as GM.

AT A GLANCE
---
* *Intelligence* (Investigation) DC 10:
  * Many of Ripplepott&#39;s bottles and
equipment in the galley are for crafting alchemical items rather than
food.  
* *Detect magic*:
 * Captain&#39;s scimitar is magical.

CONCLUSION
---
Once they find the slaves, the party has to figure out what to do with them in [[Delivering the Cargo]].

# The Legend of Shayonna
The tale tells of an amoral charlatan called Bren Taylee who
owned a local tavern. A charismatic and bald-faced liar, Taylee became
rich swindling wealthy investors by selling off unseen parcels of land
on a nearby island. He also fell madly in love with his barmaid and
married her, an innocent redheaded beauty named Shayonna. When one of
the more intrepid investors discovered the ‘rich farmland’ was, in fact,
a swamp (or a waterway, depending on the version of the story), Taylee
was forced to flee.

He left his wife Shayonna behind, abandoning her to face the furious
investors and a large debt from the tavern. The tales say that Shayonna
stowed away on the same ship Taylee fled on to escape the angry mob and
that a drunken sailor on deck one night claimed to have seen Taylee with
his hands locked around a young woman’s throat (or possibly even
throwing her limp body overboard). Whatever the truth, neither Taylee or
Shayonna were ever seen or heard from again. However, infrequent
sightings of Shayonna’s drowned ghostly spirit are reported to this day,
in or around the harbors of a number of port cities.

Whatever the truth of this legend, Shayonna does exist. Whether it was
as the tales describe, and Shayonna’s outrage at her husband’s betrayal
kept her from succumbing to death and drove her to become what she is
today or whether there was always the blackest evil in her heart and it
was she who seduced Taylee, foully murdered him, and stole his fortune,
no-one knows. But Shayonna lives and has become the powerful and
villainous hag known as &quot;the Gaunt&quot;. At present, the wicked *Sea Hag*
seeks a shipment of slaves to work her foul witchcraft upon, and
transmogrify into a horde of monstrous and slavishly obedient servitors.

# Easy Pickings
&gt; Another vessel appears in the distance. A cargo ship which, from the
look of her, has seen much better days. She moves sluggishly along,
sitting low in the water, her hull scarred with old scuffs and
scratches, her paint worn and faded, and her sails covered in patches. A
tarnished nameplate labels her the “*Tamarind*”.  

Continues at [[Easy Pickings]].

# Delivering the cargo
Among the papers in Captain Craw’s cabin, the PCs find a piece of
weathered parchment containing a curious message and rough map. The
message contains an order for a consignment of slaves and instructions
for delivery of this shipment.
