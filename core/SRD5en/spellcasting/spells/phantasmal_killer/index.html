On a failed save, the target becomes <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Frightened</a> for the duration. At the end of each of the target's turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage.
