<p>A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon. Wielding it provides a +1 enhancement bonus on <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack rolls</a>.
</p><p>You can’t add the masterwork quality to a weapon after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork weapon (see the <a href="SRD_Craft_Skill.html" title="SRD:Craft Skill">Craft</a> skill). The masterwork quality adds 300 gp to the cost of a normal weapon (or 6 gp to the cost of a single unit of ammunition). Adding the masterwork quality to a <a href="SRD_Double_Weapon.html" title="SRD:Double Weapon">double weapon</a> costs twice the normal increase (+600 gp).
</p><p>Masterwork ammunition is damaged (effectively destroyed) when used. The enhancement bonus of masterwork ammunition does not stack with any enhancement bonus of the projectile weapon firing it.
</p><p>All magic weapons are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality. The enhancement bonus granted by the masterwork quality doesn’t stack with the enhancement bonus provided by the weapon’s magic.
</p><p>Even though some types of armor and shields can be used as weapons, you can’t create a masterwork version of such an item that confers an enhancement bonus on <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack rolls</a>. Instead, <a href="SRD_Masterwork_Armor.html" title="SRD:Masterwork Armor">masterwork armor and shields</a> have lessened armor check penalties.
