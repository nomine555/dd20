<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="horn-of-blasting">Horn of Blasting</h1>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em> </p>
<p>You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Deafened</a> for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Deafened</a>. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.  <br/>
Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn. </p></div>
