<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fire_Immunity">Fire Immunity</span></h3>
<p>A creature with fire immunity never takes fire damage. It has vulnerability to cold, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from cold, regardless of whether a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.
