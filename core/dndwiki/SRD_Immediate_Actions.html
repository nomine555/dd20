<p>Much like a <a href="SRD_Swift_Actions.html" title="SRD:Swift Actions">swift action</a>, an immediate action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy than a <a href="SRD_Free_Actions.html" title="SRD:Free Actions">free action</a>. However, unlike a <a href="SRD_Swift_Actions.html" title="SRD:Swift Actions">swift action</a>, an immediate action can be performed at any time—even if it’s not your turn. Using an immediate action on your turn is the same as using a <a href="SRD_Swift_Actions.html" title="SRD:Swift Actions">swift action</a>, and counts as your <a href="SRD_Swift_Actions.html" title="SRD:Swift Actions">swift action</a> for that turn. You cannot use another immediate action or a <a href="SRD_Swift_Actions.html" title="SRD:Swift Actions">swift action</a> until after your next turn if you have used an immediate action when it is not currently your turn (effectively, using an immediate action before your turn is equivalent to using your <a href="SRD_Swift_Actions.html" title="SRD:Swift Actions">swift action</a> for the coming turn). You also cannot use an immediate action if you are currently <a href="SRD_Flat-Footed.html" title="SRD:Flat-Footed">flat-footed</a>.
