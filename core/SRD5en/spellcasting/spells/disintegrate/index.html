<p><em>6th-level transmutation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p>A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/wall_of_force/index.html">Wall of Force</a></em></strong>.  <br/>
A creature targeted by this spell must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.  <br/>
A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a <strong><em>*True <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/resurrection/index.html">Resurrection</a>*</em></strong> or a <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/wish/index.html">Wish</a></em></strong> spell.  <br/>
This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot- cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell. </p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.</p></div>
