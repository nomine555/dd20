            <p>Melting beasts hide by burrowing a few feet into the ground, then
              ambush any creatures they sense walking nearby. They work in
              groups to bring down their foes and attack by using their scythed
              appendages. </p>
            <p><b>Tunneler:</b>A melting beast can burrow through
              solid rock at a speed of 5 feet. It does not leave a usable tunnel
              unless it chooses to.</p>
            <p><b>Hiveminded :</b> Melting
              beasts are in constant communication with every other melting
              beast within 30 feet. No melting beast in a group is considered
              flanked or flatfooted unless all of them are. All Melting beast
              within 30 feet of at least one other melting beast in the same
              group act at the same initiative (make a single initiative roll
              for the entire group). </p>
            <p>A melting beast receives a +1 morale bonus on Will saves for
              every 3 other Melting beast within 30 feet. However, if a melting
              beast fails a Will save against anything that causes a shaken,
              frightened, or panicked effect, all other Melting beast in the
              group also become shaken, frightened, or panicked, respectively. </p>
            <p><b>Darkvision:</b> A
              Melting Beast's can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, 
                and in darkness as if it were dim light. 
                They can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. </p>
            <p><b>Tremorsense (30 ft):</b>
              Melting beasts are highly sensitive to ground vibrations, allowing
              them to pinpoint the location of any creature within 30 feet that
              is in contact with the ground, unless that creature is standing
              perfectly still. </p>
