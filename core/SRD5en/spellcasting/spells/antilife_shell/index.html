<p>A shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10- foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out creatures other than undead and constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.  <br/>
The barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through the barrier.  <br/>
If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.</p></div>
