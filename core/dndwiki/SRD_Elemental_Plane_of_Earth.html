<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Elemental_Plane_of_Earth">Elemental Plane of Earth</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="SRD_Elemental_Type.html" title="SRD:Elemental Type">Elemental</a> Plane of Earth is a solid place made of rock, soil, and stone. An unwary and unprepared traveler may find himself entombed within this vast solidity of material and have his life crushed into nothingness, his powdered remains a warning to any foolish enough to follow.
</p><p>Despite its solid, unyielding nature, the <a href="SRD_Elemental_Type.html" title="SRD:Elemental Type">Elemental</a> Plane of Earth is varied in its consistency, ranging from relatively soft soil to veins of heavier and more valuable metal. 
</p><p>The <a href="SRD_Elemental_Type.html" title="SRD:Elemental Type">Elemental</a> Plane of Earth has the following traits.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Earth-dominant.
</li>
<li>Enhanced magic. Spells and <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like abilities</a> that use, manipulate, or create earth or stone (including those of the Earth domain) are both empowered and extended (as if the Empower Spell and Extend Spell metamagic <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a> had been used on them, but the spells donâ€™t require higher-level slots). Spells and <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like abilities</a> that are already empowered or extended are unaffected by this benefit.
</li>
<li>Impeded magic. Spells and <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like abilities</a> that use or create air (including spells of the Air domain and spells that summon air <a href="SRD_Elemental_Type.html" title="SRD:Elemental Type">elementals</a> or <a href="SRD_Outsider_Type.html" title="SRD:Outsider Type">outsiders</a> with the air subtype) are impeded.
</li>
</ul>
