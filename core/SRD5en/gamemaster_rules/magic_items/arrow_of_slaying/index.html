<p><em>Weapon (arrow), very rare</em> </p>
<p>An <strong>arrow of slaying</strong> is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both <strong>arrows of dragon slaying</strong> and <strong>arrows of blue dragon slaying</strong>. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an <strong>arrow of slaying</strong> takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.  <br/>
Once an <strong>arrow of slaying</strong> deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.  <br/>
Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as <strong>bolts of slaying</strong> meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.</p></div>
