<p>Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses one in combat is considered to be nonproficient with it and takes a â€“4 penalty on <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack rolls</a> made with that object. To determine the <a href="SRD_Size_Category.html" title="SRD:Size Category" class="mw-redirect">size category</a> and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a <a href="SRD_Critical_Hit.html" title="SRD:Critical Hit" class="mw-redirect">critical hit</a>. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.
