<p><em>7th-level transmutation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled </p>
<p>By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Invisible</a> and can't be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.  <br/>
If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn't grow older.  <br/>
You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include "after 1,000 years" or "when the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/tarrasque/index.html">Tarrasque</a> awakens." This spell also ends if the target takes any damage. </p></div>
