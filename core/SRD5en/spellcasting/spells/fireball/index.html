<p><em>3rd-level evocation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a tiny ball of <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/bat/index.html">Bat</a> guano and sulfur)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p>A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  <br/>
The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. </p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd. </p></div>
