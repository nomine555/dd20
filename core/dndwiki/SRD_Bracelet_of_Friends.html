<p><b>Bracelet of Friends:</b> This silver charm bracelet has four charms upon it when created. The owner may designate one person known to him to be keyed to one charm. (This designation takes a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>, but once done it lasts forever or until changed.) When a charm is grasped and the name of the keyed individual is spoken, that person is called to the spot (a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>) along with his or her gear, as long as the owner and the called person are on the same plane. The keyed individual knows who is calling, and the <i>bracelet of friends </i>only functions on willing travelers. Once a charm is activated, it disappears. Charms separated from the bracelet are worthless. A bracelet found with fewer than four charms is worth 25% less for each missing charm.
