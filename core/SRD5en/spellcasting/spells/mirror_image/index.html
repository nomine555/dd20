<p><em>2nd-level illusion</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Self  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute </p>
<p>Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/mimic/index.html">Mimic</a> your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.  <br/>
Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.  <br/>
If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.  <br/>
A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.  <br/>
A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/index.html#blindsight">Blindsight</a>, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/index.html#truesight">Truesight</a>. </p></div>
