<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Planes">Planes</span></h1>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="What_Is_a_Plane.3F">What Is a Plane?</span></h3>
<p>The planes of existence are different realities with interwoven connections. Except for rare linking points, each plane is effectively its own universe with its own natural laws. 
</p><p>The planes break down into a number of general types: the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>, the Transitive Planes, the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, and the demiplanes.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Material_Plane">Material Plane</span></h5>
<p>The <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a> tends to be the most Earthlike of all planes and operates under the same set of natural laws that our own real world does. This is the default plane for most adventures.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Transitive_Planes">Transitive Planes</span></h5>
<p>These three planes have one important common characteristic: Each is used to get from one place to another. The <a href="SRD_Astral_Plane.html" title="SRD:Astral Plane">Astral Plane</a> is a conduit to all other planes, while the Ethereal Plane and the <a href="SRD_Plane_of_Shadow.html" title="SRD:Plane of Shadow">Plane of Shadow</a> both serve as means of transportation within the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a> they’re connected to. These planes have the strongest regular interaction with the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a> and are often accessed by using various spells. They have native inhabitants as well.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Inner_Planes">Inner Planes</span></h5>
<p>These six planes are manifestations of the basic building blocks of the universe. Each is made up of a single type of energy or element that overwhelms all others. The natives of a particular Inner Plane are made of the same energy or element as the plane itself.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Outer_Planes">Outer Planes</span></h5>
<p>The deities live on the Outer Planes, as do creatures such as <a href="SRD_Celestial.html" title="SRD:Celestial">celestials</a>, <a href="SRD_Demon.html" title="SRD:Demon">demons</a>, and <a href="SRD_Devil.html" title="SRD:Devil">devils</a>. Each of the Outer Planes has an alignment, representing a particular moral or ethical outlook, and the natives of each plane tend to behave in agreement with that plane’s alignment. The Outer Planes are also the final resting place of souls from the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>, whether that final rest takes the form of calm introspection or eternal damnation.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Demiplanes">Demiplanes</span></h5>
<p>This catch-all category covers all extradimensional spaces that function like planes but have measurable size and limited access. Other kinds of planes are theoretically infinite in size, but a demiplane might be only a few hundred feet across.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Planar_Traits">Planar Traits</span></h3>
<p>Each plane of existence has its own properties—the natural laws of its universe.
</p><p>Planar traits are broken down into a number of general areas.
</p><p>All planes have the following kinds of traits.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Physical_Traits">Physical Traits</span></h5>
<p>These traits determine the laws of physics and nature on the plane, including how gravity and time function.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Elemental_and_Energy_Traits">Elemental and Energy Traits</span></h5>
<p>These traits determine the dominance of particular <a href="SRD_Elemental_Type.html" title="SRD:Elemental Type">elemental</a> or energy forces.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Alignment_Traits">Alignment Traits</span></h5>
<p>Just as characters may be lawful neutral or chaotic good, many planes are tied to a particular moral or ethical outlook.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Magic_Traits">Magic Traits</span></h5>
<p>Magic works differently from plane to plane, and magic traits set the boundaries for what it can and can’t do.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Physical_Traits_2">Physical Traits</span></h3>
<p>The two most important natural laws set by physical traits are how gravity works and how time passes. Other physical traits pertain to the size and shape of a plane and how easily a plane’s nature can be altered.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Gravity">Gravity</span></h5>
<p>The direction of gravity’s pull may be unusual, and it might even change directions within the plane itself.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Normal_Gravity">Normal Gravity</span></h6>
<p>Most planes have gravity similar to that of the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>. The usual rules for ability scores, carrying capacity, and encumbrance apply. Unless otherwise noted in a description, it is assumed every plane has the normal gravity trait.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Heavy_Gravity">Heavy Gravity</span></h6>
<p>The gravity on a plane with this trait is much more intense than on the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>. As a result, <a href="SRD_Balance_Skill.html" title="SRD:Balance Skill">Balance</a>, <a href="SRD_Climb_Skill.html" title="SRD:Climb Skill">Climb</a>, <a href="SRD_Jump_Skill.html" title="SRD:Jump Skill">Jump</a>, <a href="SRD_Ride_Skill.html" title="SRD:Ride Skill">Ride</a>, <a href="SRD_Swim_Skill.html" title="SRD:Swim Skill">Swim</a>, and <a href="SRD_Tumble_Skill.html" title="SRD:Tumble Skill">Tumble</a> checks incur a –2 circumstance penalty, as do all <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack rolls</a>. All item weights are effectively doubled, which might affect a character’s speed. Weapon ranges are halved. A character’s <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> and <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dexterity</a> scores are not affected. Characters who fall on a heavy gravity plane take 1d10 points of damage for each 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d10 points of damage.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Light_Gravity">Light Gravity</span></h6>
<p>The gravity on a plane with this trait is less intense than on the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>. As a result, creatures find that they can lift more, but their movements tend to be ungainly. Characters on a plane with the light gravity trait take a –2 circumstance penalty on <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack rolls</a> and <a href="SRD_Balance_Skill.html" title="SRD:Balance Skill">Balance</a>, <a href="SRD_Ride_Skill.html" title="SRD:Ride Skill">Ride</a>, <a href="SRD_Swim_Skill.html" title="SRD:Swim Skill">Swim</a>, and <a href="SRD_Tumble_Skill.html" title="SRD:Tumble Skill">Tumble</a> checks. All items weigh half as much. Weapon ranges double, and characters gain a +2 circumstance bonus on <a href="SRD_Climb_Skill.html" title="SRD:Climb Skill">Climb</a> and <a href="SRD_Jump_Skill.html" title="SRD:Jump Skill">Jump</a> checks.
</p><p><a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> and <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dexterity</a> don’t change as a result of light gravity, but what you can do with such scores does change. These advantages apply to travelers from other planes as well as natives.
</p><p>Falling characters on a light gravity plane take 1d4 points of damage for each 10 feet of the fall (maximum 20d4).
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="No_Gravity">No Gravity</span></h6>
<p>Individuals on a plane with this trait merely float in space, unless other resources are available to provide a direction for gravity’s pull.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Objective_Directional_Gravity">Objective Directional Gravity</span></h6>
<p>The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>, but the direction is not the traditional “down” toward the ground. It may be down toward any solid object, at an angle to the surface of the plane itself, or even upward.
</p><p>In addition, objective directional gravity may change from place to place. The direction of “down” may vary.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Subjective_Directional_Gravity">Subjective Directional Gravity</span></h6>
<p>The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>, but each individual chooses the direction of gravity’s pull. Such a plane has no gravity for unattended objects and nonsentient creatures. This sort of environment can be very disorienting to the newcomer, but is common on “weightless” planes.
</p><p>Characters on a plane with subjective directional gravity can move normally along a solid surface by imagining “down” near their feet. If suspended in midair, a character “flies” by merely choosing a “down” direction and “falling” that way. Under such a procedure, an individual “falls” 150 feet in the first <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> and 300 feet in each succeeding <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. Movement is straight-line only. In order to stop, one has to slow one’s movement by changing the designated “down” direction (again, moving 150 feet in the new direction in the first <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> and 300 feet per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> thereafter).
</p><p>It takes a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 16 <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Wisdom_Check" title="SRD:Wisdom Check" class="mw-redirect">Wisdom check</a> to set a new direction of gravity as a <a href="SRD_Free_Actions.html" title="SRD:Free Actions">free action</a>; this check can be made once per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. Any character who fails this <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Wisdom_Check" title="SRD:Wisdom Check" class="mw-redirect">Wisdom check</a> in successive rounds receives a +6 bonus on subsequent checks until he or she succeeds.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Time">Time</span></h5>
<p>The rate of time’s passage can vary on different planes, though it remains constant within any particular plane. Time is always subjective for the viewer. The same subjectivity applies to various planes. Travelers may discover that they’ll pick up or lose time while moving among the planes, but from their point of view, time always passes naturally.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Normal_Time">Normal Time</span></h6>
<p>This trait describes the way time passes on the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>. One hour on a plane with normal time equals one hour on the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>. Unless otherwise noted in a description, every plane has the normal time trait.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Timeless">Timeless</span></h6>
<p>On planes with this trait, time still passes, but the effects of time are diminished. How the timeless trait can affect certain activities or conditions such as hunger, thirst, aging, the effects of poison, and healing varies from plane to plane.
</p><p>The danger of a timeless plane is that once one leaves such a plane for one where time flows normally, conditions such as hunger and aging do occur retroactively. 
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Flowing_Time">Flowing Time</span></h6>
<p>On some planes, time can flow faster or slower. One may travel to another plane, spend a year there, then return to the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a> to find that only six seconds have elapsed. Everything on the plane returned to is only a few seconds older. But for that traveler and the items, spells, and effects working on him, that year away was entirely real.
</p><p>When designating how time works on planes with flowing time, put the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>’s flow of time first, followed by the same flow in the other plane. 
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Erratic_Time">Erratic Time</span></h6>
<p>Some planes have time that slows down and speeds up, so an individual may lose or gain time as he moves between the two planes. The following is provided as an example.
</p>
<table class="d20">

<tr>
<th>d% </th>
<th>Time on<br /><a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a> </th>
<th>Time on<br />Erratic Time Plane
</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>01–10 </td>
<td>1 day </td>
<td>1 <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>
</td></tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>11–40 </td>
<td>1 day </td>
<td>1 hour
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>41–60 </td>
<td>1 day </td>
<td>1 day
</td></tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>61–90 </td>
<td>1 hour </td>
<td>1 day
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>91–100 </td>
<td>1 <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> </td>
<td>1 day
</td></tr></table>
<p>To the denizens of such a plane, time flows naturally and the shift is unnoticed.
</p><p>If a plane is timeless with respect to magic, any spell cast with a noninstantaneous duration is permanent until dispelled.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Shape_and_Size">Shape and Size</span></h5>
<p>Planes come in a variety of sizes and shapes. Most planes are infinite, or at least so large that they may as well be infinite.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Infinite">Infinite</span></h6>
<p>Planes with this trait go on forever, though they may have finite components within them. Or they may consist of ongoing expanses in two directions, like a map that stretches out infinitely.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Finite_Shape">Finite Shape</span></h6>
<p>A plane with this trait has defined edges or borders. These borders may adjoin other planes or hard, finite borders such as the edge of the world or a great wall. Demiplanes are often finite.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Self-Contained_Shape">Self-Contained Shape</span></h6>
<p>On planes with this trait, the borders wrap in on themselves, depositing the traveler on the other side of the map. A spherical plane is an example of a self-contained, finite plane, but there can be cubes, toruses, and flat planes with magical edges that teleport the traveler to an opposite edge when he crosses them. 
</p><p>Some demiplanes are self-contained.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Morphic_Traits">Morphic Traits</span></h5>
<p>This trait measures how easily the basic nature of a plane can be changed. Some planes are responsive to sentient thought, while others can be manipulated only by extremely powerful creatures. And some planes respond to physical or magical efforts.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Alterable_Morphic">Alterable Morphic</span></h6>
<p>On a plane with this trait, objects remain where they are (and what they are) unless affected by physical force or magic. You can change the immediate environment as a result of tangible effort. 
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Highly_Morphic">Highly Morphic</span></h6>
<p>On a plane with this trait, features of the plane change so frequently that it’s difficult to keep a particular area <a href="SRD_Stable.html" title="SRD:Stable">stable</a>. Such planes may react dramatically to specific spells, sentient thought, or the force of will. Others change for no reason. 
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Magically_Morphic">Magically Morphic</span></h6>
<p>Specific spells can alter the basic material of a plane with this trait.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Divinely_Morphic">Divinely Morphic</span></h6>
<p>Specific unique beings (deities or similar great powers) have the ability to alter objects, creatures, and the landscape on planes with this trait. Ordinary characters find these planes similar to alterable planes in that they may be affected by spells and physical effort. But the deities may cause these areas to change instantly and dramatically, creating great kingdoms for themselves.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Static">Static</span></h6>
<p>These planes are unchanging. Visitors cannot affect living residents of the plane, nor objects that the denizens possess. Any spells that would affect those on the plane have no effect unless the plane’s static trait is somehow removed or suppressed. Spells cast before entering a plane with the static trait remain in effect, however.
</p><p>Even moving an unattended object within a static plane requires a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 16 <a href="SRD_Strength_Check.html" title="SRD:Strength Check" class="mw-redirect">Strength check</a>. Particularly heavy objects may be impossible to move.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Sentient">Sentient</span></h6>
<p>These planes are ones that respond to a single thought— that of the plane itself. Travelers would find the plane’s landscape changing as a result of what the plane thought of the travelers, either becoming more or less hospitable depending on its reaction.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Elemental_and_Energy_Traits_2">Elemental and Energy Traits</span></h3>
<p>Four basic elements and two types of energy together make up everything. The elements are earth, air, fire, and water. The types of energy are positive and negative.
</p><p>The <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a> reflects a balancing of those elements and energies; all are found there. Each of the Inner Planes is dominated by one element or type of energy. Other planes may show off various aspects of these <a href="SRD_Elemental_Type.html" title="SRD:Elemental Type">elemental</a> traits. Many planes have no <a href="SRD_Elemental_Type.html" title="SRD:Elemental Type">elemental</a> or energy traits; these traits are noted in a plane’s description only when they are present.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Air-Dominant">Air-Dominant</span></h6>
<p>Mostly open space, planes with this trait have just a few bits of floating stone or other elements. They usually have a breathable atmosphere, though such a plane may include clouds of acidic or toxic gas. Creatures of the earth subtype are uncomfortable on air-dominant planes because they have little or no natural earth to connect with. They take no actual damage, however.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Earth-Dominant">Earth-Dominant</span></h6>
<p>Planes with this trait are mostly solid. Travelers who arrive run the risk of suffocation if they don’t reach a cavern or other pocket within the earth. Worse yet, individuals without the ability to burrow are entombed in the earth and must dig their way out (5 feet per turn). Creatures of the air subtype are uncomfortable on earth dominant planes because these planes are tight and claustrophobic to them. But they suffer no inconvenience beyond having difficulty moving.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Fire-Dominant">Fire-Dominant</span></h6>
<p>Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn without consuming their fuel source. Fire-dominant planes are extremely hostile to <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a> creatures, and those without resistance or immunity to fire are soon immolated.
</p><p>Unprotected wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials catch fire almost immediately, and those wearing unprotected flammable clothing catch on fire. In addition, individuals take 3d10 points of fire damage every <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> they are on a fire-dominant plane. Creatures of the water subtype are extremely uncomfortable on fire-dominant planes. Those that are made of water take double damage each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Water-Dominant">Water-Dominant</span></h6>
<p>Planes with this trait are mostly liquid. Visitors who can’t breathe water or reach a pocket of air will likely drown. Creatures of the fire subtype are extremely uncomfortable on water-dominant planes. Those made of fire take 1d10 points of damage each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Positive-Dominant">Positive-Dominant</span></h6>
<p>An abundance of life characterizes planes with this trait. The two kinds of positive-dominant traits are minor positive-dominant and major positive-dominant. A minor positive-dominant plane is a riotous explosion of life in all its forms. Colors are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are louder, and sensations are more intense as a result of the positive energy swirling through the plane. All individuals in a positive-dominant plane gain fast healing 2 as an <a href="SRD_Extraordinary_Ability.html" title="SRD:Extraordinary Ability" class="mw-redirect">extraordinary ability</a>.
</p><p>Major positive-dominant planes go even further. A creature on a major positive-dominant plane must make a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save to avoid being <a href="SRD_Blinded.html" title="SRD:Blinded">blinded</a> for 10 rounds by the brilliance of the surroundings. Simply being on the plane grants fast healing 5 as an <a href="SRD_Extraordinary_Ability.html" title="SRD:Extraordinary Ability" class="mw-redirect">extraordinary ability</a>. In addition, those at full <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> gain 5 additional temporary <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. These temporary <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> fade 1d20 rounds after the creature leaves the major positive- dominant plane. However, a creature must make a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 20 <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> that its temporary <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> exceed its normal hit point total. Failing the <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> results in the creature exploding in a riot of energy, killing it.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Negative-Dominant">Negative-Dominant</span></h6>
<p>Planes with this trait are vast, empty reaches that suck the life out of travelers who cross them. They tend to be lonely, haunted planes, drained of color and filled with winds bearing the soft moans of those who died within them. As with positive-dominant planes, negative-dominant planes can be either minor or major. On minor negative-dominant planes, living creatures take 1d6 points of damage per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. At 0 <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> or lower, they crumble into ash.
</p><p>Major negative-dominant planes are even more severe. Each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, those within must make a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 25 <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save or gain a negative level. A creature whose negative levels equal its current levels or <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">Hit Dice</a> is slain, becoming a wraith. The <i>death ward </i>spell protects a traveler from the damage and <a href="SRD_Energy_Drained.html" title="SRD:Energy Drained">energy drain</a> of a negative-dominant plane.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Alignment_Traits_2">Alignment Traits</span></h3>
<p>Some planes have a predisposition to a certain <a href="SRD_Alignment.html" title="SRD:Alignment">alignment</a>. Most of the inhabitants of these planes also have the plane’s particular <a href="SRD_Alignment.html" title="SRD:Alignment">alignment</a>, even powerful creatures such as deities. In addition, creatures of <a href="SRD_Alignment.html" title="SRD:Alignment">alignments</a> contrary to the plane have a tougher time dealing with its natives and situations.
</p><p>The <a href="SRD_Alignment.html" title="SRD:Alignment">alignment</a> trait of a plane affects social interactions there. Characters who follow other <a href="SRD_Alignment.html" title="SRD:Alignment">alignments</a> than most of the inhabitants do may find life more difficult.
</p><p>Alignment traits have multiple components. First are the moral (good or evil) and ethical (lawful or chaotic) components; a plane can have either a moral component, an ethical component, or one of each. Second, the specific <a href="SRD_Alignment.html" title="SRD:Alignment">alignment</a> trait indicates whether each moral or ethical component is mildly or strongly evident.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Good-Aligned.2FEvil-Aligned">Good-Aligned/Evil-Aligned</span></h6>
<p>These planes have chosen a side in the battle of good versus evil. No plane can be both good-aligned and evil-aligned.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Law-Aligned.2FChaos-Aligned">Law-Aligned/Chaos-Aligned</span></h6>
<p>Law versus chaos is the key struggle for these planes and their residents. No plane can be both law-aligned and chaos-aligned.
</p><p>Each part of the moral/ethical <a href="SRD_Alignment.html" title="SRD:Alignment">alignment</a> trait has a descriptor, either “mildly” or “strongly,” to show how powerful the influence of <a href="SRD_Alignment.html" title="SRD:Alignment">alignment</a> is on the plane.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Mildly_Aligned">Mildly Aligned</span></h6>
<p>Creatures who have an <a href="SRD_Alignment.html" title="SRD:Alignment">alignment</a> opposite that of a mildly aligned plane take a –2 circumstance penalty on all <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a>-based checks.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Strongly_Aligned">Strongly Aligned</span></h6>
<p>On planes that are strongly aligned, a –2 circumstance penalty applies on all <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a>-based checks made by all creatures not of the plane’s <a href="SRD_Alignment.html" title="SRD:Alignment">alignment</a>. In addition, the –2 penalty affects all <a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Intelligence</a>-based and <a href="SRD_Wisdom.html" title="SRD:Wisdom">Wisdom</a>-based checks, too.
</p><p>The penalties for the moral and ethical components of the <a href="SRD_Alignment.html" title="SRD:Alignment">alignment</a> trait do stack.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Neutral-Aligned">Neutral-Aligned</span></h6>
<p>A mildly neutral-aligned plane does not apply a circumstance penalty to anyone.
</p><p>The <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a> is considered mildly neutral-aligned, though it may contain high concentrations of evil or good, law or chaos in places.
</p><p>A strongly neutral-aligned plane would stand in opposition to all other moral and ethical principles: good, evil, law, and chaos. Such a plane may be more concerned with the balance of the <a href="SRD_Alignment.html" title="SRD:Alignment">alignments</a> than with accommodating and accepting alternate points of view. In the same fashion as for other strongly aligned planes, strongly neutral-aligned planes apply a –2 circumstance penalty to <a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Intelligence</a>-, <a href="SRD_Wisdom.html" title="SRD:Wisdom">Wisdom</a>-, or <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a>-based checks by any creature that isn’t neutral. The penalty is applied twice (once for law/chaos, and once for good/evil), so neutral good, neutral evil, lawful neutral, and chaotic neutral creatures take a –2 penalty and lawful good, chaotic good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil creatures take a –4 penalty.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Magic_Traits_2">Magic Traits</span></h3>
<p>A plane’s magic trait describes how magic works on the plane compared to how it works on the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>. Particular locations on a plane (such as those under the direct control of deities) may be pockets where a different magic trait applies.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Normal_Magic">Normal Magic</span></h6>
<p>This magic trait means that all spells and <a href="SRD_Supernatural_Ability.html" title="SRD:Supernatural Ability" class="mw-redirect">supernatural abilities</a> function as written. Unless otherwise noted in a description, every plane has the normal magic trait.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Wild_Magic">Wild Magic</span></h6>
<p>On a plane with the wild magic trait spells and <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like abilities</a> function in radically different and sometimes dangerous ways. Any spell or <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like ability</a> used on a wild magic plane has a chance to go awry. The caster must make a level check (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 + the level of the spell or effect) for the magic to function normally. For <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like abilities</a>, use the level or <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">HD</a> of the creature employing the ability for the <a href="SRD_Caster_Level.html" title="SRD:Caster Level" class="mw-redirect">caster level</a> check and the level of the <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like ability</a> to set the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> for the <a href="SRD_Caster_Level.html" title="SRD:Caster Level" class="mw-redirect">caster level</a> check.

<p>Planes with this trait permit only the use of spells and <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like abilities</a> that meet particular qualifications.
</p><p>Magic can be limited to effects from certain <a href="SRD_School_Specialization.html" title="SRD:School Specialization">schools or subschools</a>, to effects with certain descriptors, or to effects of a certain level (or any combination of these qualities).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="How_Planes_Interact">How Planes Interact</span></h3>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Separate_Planes">Separate Planes</span></h5>
<p>Two planes that are separate do not overlap or directly connect to each other. They are like planets in different orbits. The only way to get from one separate plane to the other is to go through a third plane.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Coterminous_Planes">Coterminous Planes</span></h5>
<p>Planes that touch at specific points are coterminous. Where they touch, a connection exists, and travelers can leave one reality behind and enter the other.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Coexistent_Planes">Coexistent Planes</span></h5>
<p>If a link between two planes can be created at any point, the two planes are coexistent. These planes overlap each other completely. A coexistent plane can be reached from anywhere on the plane it overlaps. When moving on a coexistent plane, it is often possible to see into or interact with the plane it coexists with. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Layered_Planes">Layered Planes</span></h3>
<p>Infinities may be broken into smaller infinities, and planes into smaller, related planes. These layers are effectively separate planes of existence, and each layer can have its own planar traits. Layers are connected to each other through a variety of planar gates, natural vortices, paths, and shifting borders.
</p><p>Access to a layered plane from elsewhere usually happens on a specific layer: the first layer of the plane, which can be either the top layer or the bottom layer, depending on the specific plane. Most fixed access points (such as portals and natural vortices) reach this layer, which makes it the gateway for other layers of the plane. The <i>plane shift </i>spell also deposits the spellcaster on the first layer of the plane.
