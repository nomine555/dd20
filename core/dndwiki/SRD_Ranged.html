<p><b>Ranged:</b> The wielder of a ranged shield can throw it in combat, with a range increment of 30 feet. While in the air, the shield is treated in all ways as a <a href="SRD_Ranged_Weapon.html" title="SRD:Ranged Weapon">ranged weapon</a> and cannot be blocked or grabbed except by those with appropriate <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a>. No matter the size of the wielder, a <a href="SRD_Buckler.html" title="SRD:Buckler">buckler</a> or <a href="SRD_Light_Shield.html" title="SRD:Light Shield">light shield</a> deals 1d6 points of damage and a <a href="SRD_Heavy_Shield.html" title="SRD:Heavy Shield">heavy</a> one 1d8 points. (A <a href="SRD_Tower_Shield.html" title="SRD:Tower Shield">tower shield</a> cannot be created with this special ability.) The wielder’s <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> modifier and the shield’s enhancement bonus add to the base damage.
</p><p>A ranged shield flies through the air back to the creature that threw it. It returns to the wielder just before the creature’s next turn (and is therefore ready to use again in that turn).
</p><p>Catching a ranged shield when it comes back is a <a href="SRD_Free_Actions.html" title="SRD:Free Actions">free action</a>. If the wielder can’t catch it, or if the wielder has moved since throwing it, the shield drops to the ground in the square from which it was thrown.
