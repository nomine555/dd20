<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="freedom-of-movement">Freedom of Movement</h1>
<p><em>4th-level abjuration</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour </p>
<p>You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/combat/movement_and_position/index.html#difficult-terrain">Difficult Terrain</a>, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Paralyzed</a> or <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a>.  <br/>
The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Grappled</a>. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target's movement or attacks.</p></div>
