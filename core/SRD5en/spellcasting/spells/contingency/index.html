<p><em>6th-level evocation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Self  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved from ivory and decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 gp)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 10 days </p>
<p>Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell--called the contingent spell--as part of casting <strong><em>contingency</em></strong>, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a <strong><em>contingency</em></strong> cast with <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/water_breathing/index.html">Water Breathing</a></em></strong> might stipulate that <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/water_breathing/index.html">Water Breathing</a></em></strong> comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.  <br/>
The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then <strong><em>contingency</em></strong> ends. The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one <strong><em>contingency</em></strong> spell at a time.  <br/>
If you cast this spell again, the effect of another <strong><em>contingency</em></strong> spell on you ends. Also, <strong><em>contingency</em></strong> ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.</p></div>
