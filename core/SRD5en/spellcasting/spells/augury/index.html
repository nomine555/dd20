<p><em>2nd-level Divination (ritual)</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute <br/>
<strong>Range</strong>: Self <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp) <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous <br/>
By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the following possible omens:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weal</strong>, for good results</li>
<li><strong>Woe</strong>, for bad results</li>
<li><strong>Weal and woe</strong>, for both good and bad results</li>
<li><strong>Nothing</strong>, for results that aren't especially good or bad </li>
</ul>
<p>The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.  <br/>
If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret. </p></div>
