<p><b>Benefit:</b> As a <a href="SRD_Free_Actions.html" title="SRD:Free Actions">free action</a>, the deity can assume any size from Fine to Colossal. The deity also can change the size of up to 100 pounds of objects it touches. If the deity has a familiar, personal mount, or personal intelligent weapon, the creature can change size with the deity if the deity touches it, but its weight counts against the deity’s weight limit. This is a <a href="SRD_Supernatural_Ability.html" title="SRD:Supernatural Ability" class="mw-redirect">supernatural ability</a>.
</p><p><b>Notes:</b> This ability allows the deity to assume any proportions from the size of a grain of sand up or as much as 1,600 feet tall. A radical change in size can have great impact on the deity’s combat ability.

The deity’s <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> score can never be reduced to less than 1 through this ability. Also note that use of this divine ability does not affect all the deities’ characteristics.
