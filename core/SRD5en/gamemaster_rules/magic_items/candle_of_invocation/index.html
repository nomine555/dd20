<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em> </p>
<p>This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity's alignment. The candle's alignment can be detected with the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/detect_evil_and_good/index.html">Detect Evil and Good</a></em></strong> spell. The GM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly. </p>

<p>The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.  <br/>
While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a>. In addition, a cleric or <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/druid/index.html">Druid</a> in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st- level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.  <br/>
Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/gate/index.html">Gate</a></em></strong> spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle. </p></div>
