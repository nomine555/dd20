<p><em>Potion, rare</em> </p>
<p>When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/gaseous_form/index.html">Gaseous Form</a></em></strong> spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. This potion's container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.</p></div>
