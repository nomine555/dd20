<p><em>Wondrous item, rarity by figurine</em> </p>
<p>A <strong>figurine of wondrous power</strong> is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.  <br/>
The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.  <br/>
The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.  <br/>

<p><strong>Golden Lions (Rare).</strong> These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/lion/index.html">Lion</a> for up to 1 hour. Once a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/lion/index.html">Lion</a> has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.  <br/>
<strong>Ivory Goats (Rare).</strong> These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/goat/index.html">Goat</a> looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/goat/index.html">Goat</a> of traveling</em> can become a Large <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/goat/index.html">Goat</a> with the same statistics as a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/riding_horse/index.html">Riding Horse</a>. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.   </li>
<li>The <em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/goat/index.html">Goat</a> of travail</em> becomes a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/giant_goat/index.html">Giant Goat</a> for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.</li>
<li>The <em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/goat/index.html">Goat</a> of terror</em> becomes a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/giant_goat/index.html">Giant Goat</a> for up to 3 hours. The <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/goat/index.html">Goat</a> can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a <strong>+1 lance</strong>, and the other becomes a <strong>+2 longsword</strong>. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/goat/index.html">Goat</a> reverts to figurine form. In addition, the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/goat/index.html">Goat</a> radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> saving throw or be <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Frightened</a> of the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/goat/index.html">Goat</a> for 1 minute, or until the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/goat/index.html">Goat</a> reverts to figurine form. The <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Frightened</a> creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.    </li>
</ul>

It can become an <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/elephant/index.html">Elephant</a> for up to 24 hours.

<strong>Obsidian Steed (Very Rare).</strong> This polished obsidian horse can become a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/nightmare/index.html">Nightmare</a> for up to 24 hours.

Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.  <br/>
If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/nightmare/index.html">Nightmare</a> while it is ignoring your orders, you and the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/nightmare/index.html">Nightmare</a> are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/nightmare/index.html">Nightmare</a> reverts to figurine form.   <br/>
