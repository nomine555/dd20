<p>A <i>confused </i>character’s actions are determined by rolling d% at the beginning of his turn:
</p>
<table class="d20">

<tr>
<th> d% </th>
<th align="left"> Action
</th></tr>
<tr>
<td> 01–10 </td>
<td align="left"> Attack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attacking is not possible)
</td></tr>
<tr class="even">
<td> 11–20 </td>
<td align="left"> Act normally
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> 21–50 </td>
<td align="left"> Do nothing but babble incoherently
</td></tr>
<tr class="even">
<td> 51–70 </td>
<td align="left"> Flee away from caster at top possible speed
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> 71–100 </td>
<td align="left"> Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject’s self ).
</td></tr></table>
<p>A <i>confused </i>character who can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a <i>confused </i>character. Any <i>confused </i>character who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still <i>confused </i>when its turn comes. A <i>confused </i>character does not make <a href="SRD_Attacks_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attacks of Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a> against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked).
