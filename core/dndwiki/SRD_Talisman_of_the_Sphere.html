<p><b>Talisman of the Sphere:</b> This small adamantine loop and handle are useless to those unable to cast arcane spells. Characters who cannot cast arcane spells take 5d6 points of damage merely from picking up and holding a talisman of this sort. However, when held by an arcane spellcaster who is concentrating on control of a <i><a href="SRD_Sphere_of_Annihilation.html" title="SRD:Sphere of Annihilation">sphere of annihilation</a>, </i>a <i>talisman of the sphere </i>doubles the character’s modifier on his control check (doubling both his <a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Intelligence</a> bonus and his character level for this purpose).
</p><p>If the wielder of a talisman establishes control, he need check for maintaining control only every other <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> thereafter. If control is not established, the sphere moves toward him. Note that while many spells and effects of cancellation have no effect upon a <i>sphere of annihilation, </i>the talisman’s power of control can be suppressed or canceled.
