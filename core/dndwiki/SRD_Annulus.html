<p><b>Annulus:</b> This artifact is the ultimate psionic nullifier. Forged to keep enemies of vast psionic power at bay, the <i>Annulus</i> is an artifact that any psionic being should fear. It has been forgotten in the modern age, and merely finding it would precipitate a great upheaval across the planes.
</p><p>The <i>Annulus</i> is a 1-foot-diameter ring of silvery material. Tiny slots, antennae, spheres, and other intricate projections decorate the exterior of the hoop; however, two smoothed lengths of the ring provide an adequate surface for grasping the item.
</p><p>The <i>Annulus</i> has several <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, all of which require a wielder to tightly grasp the ring with at least one hand. When it is first grasped, knowledge of the artifact’s <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> immediately flood the wielder’s mind. The wielder can access all <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> of the <i>Annulus</i> at <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a> 20th.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The <i>Annulus</i> generates a continuous <i><a href="SRD_Catapsi.html" title="SRD:Catapsi">catapsi</a></i> effect within a 100-foot-radius of the wielder (who is unaffected).
</li>
<li> The wielder gains a +4 enhancement bonus on any attempt to resist an effect that deals <a href="SRD_Ability_Damage.html" title="SRD:Ability Damage" class="mw-redirect">ability damage</a>.
</li>
<li> Once per day, the wielder can trigger <i><a href="SRD_Ultrablast.html" title="SRD:Ultrablast">ultrablast</a></i> as a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>.
</li>
<li> Three times per day, as a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>, the wielder can trigger an effect similar to <i><a href="SRD_Psionic_Dimensional_Anchor.html" title="SRD:Psionic Dimensional Anchor">psionic dimensional anchor</a></i> that affects all creatures in a 50-foot radius.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary power of the <i>Annulus</i>, however, is psionic nullification. Once per year, the wielder can trigger this effect as a special action requiring 10 rounds of continuous concentration to complete. The wielder specifies a target or targets within a 100-foot radius, ranging from a specific psionic individual or item to a group of psionic beings that share the same philosophy. The nullification effect is accompanied by blasts of light, heat, and sound from the <i>Annulus</i>. Nonpsionic creatures and items are unaffected, as are nontargeted beings, but any psionic target—regardless of any protection it may possess—disintegrates in a terrific explosion. Nothing is left but floating dust.
</p><p>It is relatively easy to nullify a single target or a small group of targets, but nullifying a more powerful being (such as a demigod or greater entity) or another major artifact taxes the <i>Annulus</i> to its limits. If it is used to nullify such a target, the artifact succeeds but is destroyed in the process and cannot be retrieved by any means.
