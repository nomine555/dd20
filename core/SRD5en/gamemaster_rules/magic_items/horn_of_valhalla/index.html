<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="horn-of-valhalla">Horn of Valhalla</h1>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary (iron)</em> </p>
<p>You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/berserker/index.html">Berserker</a>. They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.  <br/>
Four types of <strong>horn of Valhalla</strong> are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly. </p>
