<p>The creature can choose to start a <a href="SRD_Grapple.html" title="SRD:Grapple">grapple</a> when it hits with a claw or bite attack, as though it had the <a href="SRD_Improved_Grab.html" title="SRD:Improved Grab">improved grab</a> special attack. If the creature gets a hold on a creature three or more sizes smaller, it squeezes each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> for automatic bite or claw damage. A snatched opponent held in the creature’s mouth is not allowed a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> save against the creature’s <a href="SRD_Breath_Weapon.html" title="SRD:Breath Weapon">breath weapon</a>, if it has one.
</p><p>The creature can drop a creature it has snatched as a <a href="SRD_Free_Actions.html" title="SRD:Free Actions">free action</a> or use a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> to fling it aside. A flung creature travels 1d6 &#215; 10 feet, and takes 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet traveled. If the creature flings a snatched opponent while flying, the opponent takes this amount or falling damage, whichever is greater.
