<p><em>Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)</em> </p>
<p>When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 3d6 necrotic damage, provided that the target isn't a construct or an undead. You gain temporary hit points equal to the extra damage dealt. </p></div>
