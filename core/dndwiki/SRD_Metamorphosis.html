<p>You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form, or any other type except <a href="SRD_Construct_Type.html" title="SRD:Construct Type">construct</a>, <a href="SRD_Elemental_Type.html" title="SRD:Elemental Type">elemental</a>, <a href="SRD_Outsider_Type.html" title="SRD:Outsider Type">outsider</a>, and <a href="SRD_Undead_Type.html" title="SRD:Undead Type">undead</a>. The assumed form can have as many <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">Hit Dice</a> as your <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>, to a maximum of 15.
</p><p>You can’t assume a form smaller than Fine, nor can you assume an <a href="SRD_Incorporeal.html" title="SRD:Incorporeal">incorporeal</a>, ectoplasmic, or gaseous form. You cannot take the form of any creature that has a template. Your type and subtype (if applicable) change to match the new form.
</p><p>Upon changing, you regain lost <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> as if you had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore <a href="SRD_Ability_Damage.html" title="SRD:Ability Damage" class="mw-redirect">ability damage</a> and provide other benefits of resting; and changing back does not heal you further). If you are slain while under the effect of this power, you revert to your original form, though you remain <a href="SRD_Dead.html" title="SRD:Dead">dead</a>. You gain the <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a>, <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dexterity</a>, and <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a> scores of the new form but retain your own <a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Intelligence</a>, <a href="SRD_Wisdom.html" title="SRD:Wisdom">Wisdom</a>, and <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a> scores. You also gain all extraordinary special attacks possessed by the form (such as constrict, improved grab, and poison) but do not gain the extraordinary special qualities possessed by the new form (such as <a href="SRD_Blindsight_and_Blindsense.html" title="SRD:Blindsight and Blindsense">blindsense</a>, <a href="SRD_Fast_Healing.html" title="SRD:Fast Healing">fast healing</a>, <a href="SRD_Regeneration.html" title="SRD:Regeneration">regeneration</a>, and <a href="SRD_Scent.html" title="SRD:Scent">scent</a>) or any supernatural, psionic, or spelllike abilities.
</p><p>You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and special qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have, if any. You keep all extraordinary special attacks and special qualities derived from <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">class levels</a>, but you lose any benefits of the racial traits of your normal form. If you have a template, special abilities it provides are likewise not retained. If the assumed form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any manifesting ability you had in your original form.
</p><p>You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), <a href="SRD_Natural_Armor_Bonus.html" title="SRD:Natural Armor Bonus" class="mw-redirect">natural armor bonus</a>, <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Natural_Weapon" title="SRD:Natural Weapon" class="mw-redirect">natural weapons</a> (such as claws or a bite), racial bonuses on <a href="SRD_Skill_Check.html" title="SRD:Skill Check" class="mw-redirect">skill checks</a>, racial bonus <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a>, and any anatomical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
</p><p>You can freely designate the new form’s minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that type. The new form’s significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form’s species. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form’s race. If you use this power to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your <a href="SRD_Disguise_Skill.html" title="SRD:Disguise Skill">Disguise</a> check.
</p><p>When the change occurs, your equipment either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item in question) or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your normal form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can’t wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held in the same way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its normal form.
</p><p>You can also use this power to assume the form of an inanimate object. You gain the object’s hardness and retain your own <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>. You can take the shape of almost any simple object you can think of. If you attempt to take the form of a complex object, you must make an appropriate <a href="SRD_Skill_Check.html" title="SRD:Skill Check" class="mw-redirect">skill check</a>.. If you fail the check, your manifestation of the power does not succeed. Likewise, you cannot take the form of a complex mechanical mechanism unless you have some sort of skill associated with the object. You cannot use this power to assume the form of a psionic item or a magic item, or any object with a hardness of 15 or higher. You also cannot take the form of a psionically animated mechanism or any object formed of ectoplasm.
</p><p>As an inanimate object, you lose all mobility. You retain your normal senses and your ability to speak. You can manifest a power if you make a <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> check (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 20 + power level); however, doing so ends the duration of this power. If you take damage while in the form of an object, your actual body also takes damage (but the object’s hardness, if any, protects you).
