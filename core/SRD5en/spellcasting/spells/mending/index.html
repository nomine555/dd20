<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (two lodestones)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p>This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.  <br/>
This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object. </p></div>
