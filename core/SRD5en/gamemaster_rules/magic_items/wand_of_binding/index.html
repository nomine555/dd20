<p><em>Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)</em> </p>
<p>This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.  <br/>
<strong>Spells.</strong> While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/hold_monster/index.html">Hold Monster</a></em></strong> (5 charges) or <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/hold_person/index.html">Hold Person</a></em></strong> (2 charges).  <br/>
<strong>Assisted Escape.</strong> While holding the wand, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and gain <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a> on a saving throw you make to avoid being <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Paralyzed</a> or <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a>, or you can expend 1 charge and gain <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a> on any check you make to escape a grapple. </p></div>
