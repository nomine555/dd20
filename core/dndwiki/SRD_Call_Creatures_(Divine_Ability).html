<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Call_Creatures">Call Creatures</span></h2>
<p><b>Benefit:</b> The kind of creature the deity can call is noted in the deity’s description. Each creature called can have no more <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">Hit Dice</a> than the deity has divine ranks, and the deity cannot have more creatures serving it at any given time than the deity has ranks. The creatures are transported to the deity’s presence through an interdimensional connection similar to that created by a <i><a href="SRD_Gate.html" title="SRD:Gate">gate</a> </i>spell, except that it opens to the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>. The creatures willingly serve to the best of their ability. The calling effect is otherwise similar to the calling property of the <i><a href="SRD_Gate.html" title="SRD:Gate">gate</a> </i>spell.
</p><p><b>Notes:</b> A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of creature each time.
</p><p><b>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</b> Any.
