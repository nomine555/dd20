<p><b>Spell Storing, Minor:</b> A <i>minor ring of spell storing </i>contains up to three levels of spells that the wearer can cast. Each spell has a <a href="SRD_Caster_Level.html" title="SRD:Caster Level" class="mw-redirect">caster level</a> equal to the minimum level needed to cast that spell. The user need not provide any material components or focus, or pay an XP cost to cast the spell, and there is no <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Arcane_Spell_Failure_Chance" title="SRD:Arcane Spell Failure Chance" class="mw-redirect">arcane spell failure chance</a> for wearing armor (because the ring wearer need not gesture). The activation time for the ring is same as the casting time for the relevant spell, with a minimum of 1 <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>.
</p><p>For a randomly generated ring, treat it as a scroll to determine what spells are stored in it. If you roll a spell that would put the ring over the three-level limit, ignore that roll; the ring has no more spells in it. (Not every newly discovered ring need be fully charged.)
</p><p>A spellcaster can cast any spells into the ring, so long as the total <a href="SRD_Spell_Level.html" title="SRD:Spell Level" class="mw-redirect">spell levels</a> do not add up to more than three. Metamagic versions of spells take up storage space equal to their <a href="SRD_Spell_Level.html" title="SRD:Spell Level" class="mw-redirect">spell level</a> modified by the metamagic <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>. A spellcaster can use a scroll to put a spell into the <i>minor ring of spell storing.</i>
</p><p>The ring magically imparts to the wearer the names of all spells currently stored within it.
