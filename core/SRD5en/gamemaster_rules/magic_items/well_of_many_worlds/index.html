<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="well-of-many-worlds">Well of Many Worlds</h1>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em> </p>
<p>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.  <br/>
You can use an action to unfold and place the <strong>well of many worlds</strong> on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once <strong>well of many worlds</strong> has opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours. </p></div>
