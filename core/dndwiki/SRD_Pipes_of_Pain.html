<p><b>Pipes of Pain:</b> These appear to be like any other standard set of pipes with nothing to reveal their true nature.

(This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion.)
</p><p>As soon as the piping stops, all those affected are stricken by intense pain at even the slightest noise. Unless a character is in a totally silent area, she takes 1d4 points of damage per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> for 2d4 rounds. During this time, damage from sonic attacks is doubled. Thereafter, the least noise causes an affected character to become <a href="SRD_Shaken.html" title="SRD:Shaken">shaken</a> (except when she is in a totally silent area). This hypersensitivity is a curse and therefore hard to remove (see the <i><a href="SRD_Bestow_Curse.html" title="SRD:Bestow Curse">bestow curse</a> </i>spell).
