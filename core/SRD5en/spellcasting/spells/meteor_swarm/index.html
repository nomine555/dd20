<p><em>9th-level evocation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 1 mile  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p>Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.  <br/>
The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried. </p></div>
