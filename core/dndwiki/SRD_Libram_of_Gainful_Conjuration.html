<p><b>Libram of Gainful Conjuration: </b>This mystic book is of great value to arcane spellcasters of good alignment (LG, NG, CG). Study of the work requires one week. Upon completion, the good arcane caster gains a +1 inherent bonus to the <a href="SRD_Ability_Scores.html" title="SRD:Ability Scores">ability score</a> controlling his or her arcane spellcasting ability and experience points sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the reader has levels in more than one arcane spellcasting <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a>, he or she must choose one of the <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">classes</a> to be affected.) Nongood arcane spellcasters (LN, N, CN, LE, NE, or CE) are permanently drained of 1d4+1 points of <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a> and must atone (see the <i><a href="SRD_Atonement.html" title="SRD:Atonement">atonement</a> </i>spell) in order to gain any further experience. Anyone incapable of casting arcane spells who reads even a single word of the work must make a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Will</a> save (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 20) or suffer insanity (see the <i>insanity</i> spell). Except as indicated above, the writing in a <i>libram of gainful conjuration </i>canâ€™t be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character ever benefit from reading a similar tome a second time.
