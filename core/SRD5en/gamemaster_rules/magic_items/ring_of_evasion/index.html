<p><em>Ring, rare (requires attunement)</em> </p>
<p>This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you fail a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw while wearing it, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges to succeed on that saving throw instead. </p></div>
