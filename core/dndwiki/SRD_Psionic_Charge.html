<p>To use this <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>, you must expend your psionic focus. When you charge, you can make one turn of up to 90 degrees during your movement. All other restrictions on charges still apply; for instance, you cannot pass through a square that blocks or slows movement, or that contains a creature. You must have line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn.
