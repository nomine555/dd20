<p><em>Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/druid/index.html">Druid</a>, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)</em> </p>
<p>This staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/swarm_of_insects/index.html">Swarm of Insects</a> consumes and destroys the staff, then disperses.  <br/>
<strong>Spells.</strong> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/giant_insect/index.html">Giant Insect</a></em></strong> (4 charges) or <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/insect_plague/index.html">Insect Plague</a></em></strong> (5 charges).  <br/>
<strong>Insect Cloud.</strong> While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to spread out in a 30-foot radius from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, making the area heavily obscured for creatures other than you. The swarm moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the swarm and ends the effect. </p></div>
