<p>You can create any <a href="SRD_Rods.html" title="SRD:Rods">rod</a> whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a rod takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a rod, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of its base price.
</p><p>Some rods incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the rodâ€™s base price.
