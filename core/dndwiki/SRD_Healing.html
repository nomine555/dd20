<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Healing">Healing</span></h3>
<p>After taking damage, you can recover <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> through natural healing or through magical healing. In any case, you can’t regain <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> past your full normal hit point total.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Natural_Healing">Natural Healing</span></h5>
<p>With a full night’s rest (8 hours of sleep or more), you recover 1 hit point per character level. Any significant interruption during your rest prevents you from healing that night.
</p><p>If you undergo complete bed rest for an entire day and night, you recover twice your character level in <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Magical_Healing">Magical Healing</span></h5>
<p>Various abilities and spells can restore <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Healing_Limits">Healing Limits</span></h5>
<p>You can never recover more <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> than you lost. Magical healing won’t raise your current <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> higher than your full normal hit point total.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Healing_Ability_Damage">Healing Ability Damage</span></h5>
<p><a href="SRD_Ability_Damage.html" title="SRD:Ability Damage" class="mw-redirect">Ability damage</a> is temporary, just as hit point damage is. <a href="SRD_Ability_Damage.html" title="SRD:Ability Damage" class="mw-redirect">Ability damage</a> returns at the rate of 1 point per night of rest (8 hours) for each affected <a href="SRD_Ability_Scores.html" title="SRD:Ability Scores">ability score</a>. Complete bed rest restores 2 points per day (24 hours) for each affected <a href="SRD_Ability_Scores.html" title="SRD:Ability Scores">ability score</a>.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Stable_Characters_and_Recovery">Stable Characters and Recovery</span></h3>
<p>On the next turn after a character is reduced to between –1 and –9 <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> and on all subsequent turns, roll d% to see whether the <a href="SRD_Dying.html" title="SRD:Dying">dying</a> character becomes <a href="SRD_Stable.html" title="SRD:Stable">stable</a>. He has a 10% chance of becoming <a href="SRD_Stable.html" title="SRD:Stable">stable</a>. If he doesn’t, he loses 1 hit point. (A character who’s unconscious or <a href="SRD_Dying.html" title="SRD:Dying">dying</a> can’t use any special action that changes the initiative count on which his action occurs.)
</p><p>If the character’s <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> drop to –10 or lower, he’s <a href="SRD_Dead.html" title="SRD:Dead">dead</a>.
</p><p>You can keep a <a href="SRD_Dying.html" title="SRD:Dying">dying</a> character from losing any more <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> and make him <a href="SRD_Stable.html" title="SRD:Stable">stable</a> with a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 <a href="SRD_Heal_Skill.html" title="SRD:Heal Skill">Heal</a> check.
</p><p>If any sort of healing cures the <a href="SRD_Dying.html" title="SRD:Dying">dying</a> character of even 1 point of damage, he stops losing <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> and becomes <a href="SRD_Stable.html" title="SRD:Stable">stable</a>.
</p><p>Healing that raises the <a href="SRD_Dying.html" title="SRD:Dying">dying</a> character’s <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> to 0 makes him conscious and <a href="SRD_Disabled.html" title="SRD:Disabled">disabled</a>. Healing that raises his <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> to 1 or more makes him fully functional again, just as if he’d never been reduced to 0 or lower. A spellcaster retains the spellcasting capability she had before dropping below 0 <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>.
</p><p>A <a href="SRD_Stable.html" title="SRD:Stable">stable</a> character who has been tended by a healer or who has been magically healed eventually regains consciousness and recovers <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> naturally. If the character has no one to tend him, however, his life is still in danger, and he may yet slip away.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Recovering_with_Help">Recovering with Help</span></h5>
<p>One hour after a tended, <a href="SRD_Dying.html" title="SRD:Dying">dying</a> character becomes <a href="SRD_Stable.html" title="SRD:Stable">stable</a>, roll d%. He has a 10% chance of becoming conscious, at which point he is <a href="SRD_Disabled.html" title="SRD:Disabled">disabled</a> (as if he had 0 <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>). If he remains unconscious, he has the same chance to revive and become <a href="SRD_Disabled.html" title="SRD:Disabled">disabled</a> every hour. Even if unconscious, he recovers <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> naturally. He is back to normal when his <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> rise to 1 or higher.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Recovering_without_Help">Recovering without Help</span></h5>
<p>A severely wounded character left alone usually dies. He has a small chance, however, of recovering on his own.
</p><p>A character who becomes <a href="SRD_Stable.html" title="SRD:Stable">stable</a> on his own (by making the 10% roll while <a href="SRD_Dying.html" title="SRD:Dying">dying</a>) and who has no one to tend to him still loses <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>, just at a slower rate. He has a 10% chance each hour of becoming conscious. Each time he misses his hourly roll to become conscious, he loses 1 hit point. He also does not recover <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> through natural healing.
</p><p>Even once he becomes conscious and is <a href="SRD_Disabled.html" title="SRD:Disabled">disabled</a>, an unaided character still does not recover <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> naturally. Instead, each day he has a 10% chance to start recovering <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> naturally (starting with that day); otherwise, he loses 1 hit point.
</p><p>Once an unaided character starts recovering <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> naturally, he is no longer in danger of naturally losing <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> (even if his current hit point total is negative).
