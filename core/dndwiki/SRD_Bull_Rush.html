<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bull_Rush">Bull Rush</span></h3>
<p>You can make a bull rush as a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> (an attack) or as part of a <a href="SRD_Charge.html" title="SRD:Charge">charge</a>. When you make a bull rush, you attempt to push an opponent straight back instead of damaging him. You can only bull rush an opponent who is one <a href="SRD_Size_Category.html" title="SRD:Size Category" class="mw-redirect">size category</a> larger than you, the same size, or smaller.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Initiating_a_Bull_Rush">Initiating a Bull Rush</span></h5>
<p>First, you move into the defender’s space. Doing this provokes an <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attack of opportunity</a> from each opponent that threatens you, including the defender. (If you have the <a href="SRD_Improved_Bull_Rush.html" title="SRD:Improved Bull Rush">Improved Bull Rush</a> <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>, you don’t provoke an <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attack of opportunity</a> from the defender.) Any <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attack of opportunity</a> made by anyone other than the defender against you during a bull rush has a 25% chance of accidentally targeting the defender instead, and any <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attack of opportunity</a> by anyone other than you against the defender likewise has a 25% chance of accidentally targeting you. (When someone makes an <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attack of opportunity</a>, make the <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack roll</a> and then roll to see whether the attack went astray.) 
</p><p>Second, you and the defender make opposed <a href="SRD_Strength_Check.html" title="SRD:Strength Check" class="mw-redirect">Strength checks</a>. You each add a +4 bonus for each <a href="SRD_Size_Category.html" title="SRD:Size Category" class="mw-redirect">size category</a> you are larger than Medium or a –4 penalty for each <a href="SRD_Size_Category.html" title="SRD:Size Category" class="mw-redirect">size category</a> you are smaller than Medium. You get a +2 bonus if you are charging. The defender gets a +4 bonus if he has more than two legs or is otherwise exceptionally stable.

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Bull_Rush_Results">Bull Rush Results</span></h5>
<p>If you beat the defender’s <a href="SRD_Strength_Check.html" title="SRD:Strength Check" class="mw-redirect">Strength check</a> result, you push him back 5 feet. If you wish to move with the defender, you can push him back an additional 5 feet for each 5 points by which your check result is greater than the defender’s check result. You can’t, however, exceed your normal movement limit. (<i>Note: </i>The defender provokes <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a> if he is moved. So do you, if you move with him. The two of you do not provoke <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a> from each other, however.)
</p><p>If you fail to beat the defender’s <a href="SRD_Strength_Check.html" title="SRD:Strength Check" class="mw-redirect">Strength check</a> result, you move 5 feet straight back to where you were before you moved into his space. If that space is occupied, you fall <a href="SRD_Prone.html" title="SRD:Prone">prone</a> in that space.
