<p>A panicked creature must drop anything it holds and flee at top speed from the source of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random path. It can’t take any other actions. In addition, the creature takes a –2 penalty on all <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throws</a>, <a href="SRD_Skill_Check.html" title="SRD:Skill Check" class="mw-redirect">skill checks</a>, and <a href="SRD_Ability_Check.html" title="SRD:Ability Check" class="mw-redirect">ability checks</a>. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers and does not attack, typically using the total defense action in combat. A panicked creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.
</p><p>Panicked is a more extreme state of fear than <a href="SRD_Shaken.html" title="SRD:Shaken">shaken</a> or <a href="SRD_Frightened.html" title="SRD:Frightened">frightened</a>.
