<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em> </p>
<p>While this bowl is filled with water, you can use an action to speak the bowl's command word and summon a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/water_elemental/index.html">Water Elemental</a>, as if you had cast the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/conjure_elemental/index.html">Conjure Elemental</a></em></strong> spell. The bowl can't be used this way again until the next dawn.  <br/>
The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It weighs 3 pounds and holds about 3 gallons. </p></div>
