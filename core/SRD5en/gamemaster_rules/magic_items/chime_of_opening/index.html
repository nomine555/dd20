<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em> </p>
<p>This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and weighs 1 pound. You can strike it as an action, pointing it at an object within 120 feet of you that can be opened, such as a door, lid, or lock. The chime issues a clear tone, and one lock or latch on the object opens unless the sound can't reach the object. If no locks or latches remain, the object itself opens.  <br/>
The chime can be used ten times. After the tenth time, it cracks and becomes useless. </p></div>
