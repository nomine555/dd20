<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="cloak-of-displacement">Cloak of Displacement</h1>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em> </p>
<p>While you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while you are <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Incapacitated</a>, <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a>, or otherwise unable to move. </p></div>
