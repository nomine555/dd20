<p>A creature with this <a href="SRD_Extraordinary_Ability.html" title="SRD:Extraordinary Ability" class="mw-redirect">extraordinary ability</a> is difficult to kill. Damage dealt to the creature is treated as <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a>. The creature automatically heals <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> at a fixed rate per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, as given in the entry. Certain attack forms, typically fire and acid, deal lethal damage to the creature, which doesn’t go away. The creature’s descriptive text describes the details. A regenerating creature that has been rendered unconscious through <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> can be killed with a coup de grace. The attack cannot be of a type that automatically converts to <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a>.  An attack that can cause instant death only threatens the creature with death if it is delivered by weapons that deal it lethal damage.
</p><p>Attack forms that don’t deal hit point damage ignore regeneration. Regeneration also does not restore <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation. Regenerating creatures can regrow lost portions of their bodies and can reattach severed limbs or body parts; details are in the creature’s descriptive text. Severed parts that are not reattached wither and die normally.
</p><p>A creature must have a <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a> score to have the regeneration ability.
