<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Paladin.27s_Mount">The Paladin's Mount</span></h4>
<p>The paladin’s mount is superior to a normal mount of its kind and has special powers, as described below. The standard mount for a Medium paladin is a <a href="SRD_Heavy_Warhorse.html" title="SRD:Heavy Warhorse">heavy warhorse</a>, and the standard mount for a Small paladin is a <a href="SRD_War_Pony.html" title="SRD:War Pony">warpony</a>. Another kind of mount, such as a <a href="SRD_Riding_Dog.html" title="SRD:Riding Dog">riding dog</a> (for a <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Halflings_(Race)" title="SRD:Halflings (Race)" class="mw-redirect">halfling</a> paladin) or a <a href="SRD_Shark.html" title="SRD:Shark">Large shark</a> (for a paladin in an aquatic campaign) may be allowed as well.
</p><p>A paladin’s mount is treated as a magical beast, not an animal, for the purpose of all effects that depend on its type (though it retains an animal’s HD, base attack bonus, saves, skill points, and feats).

<p><b>Paladin’s Mount Basics:</b> Use the base statistics for a creature of the mount’s kind, but make changes to take into account the attributes and characteristics summarized on the table and described below.
</p><p><i><span id="Bonus_HD">Bonus HD</span>:</i> Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Consitution</a> modifier, as normal. Extra Hit Dice improve the mount’s base attack and base save bonuses. A special mount’s base attack bonus is equal to that of a cleric of a level equal to the mount’s HD. A mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal’s HD). The mount gains additional skill points or feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster’s Hit Dice.
</p><p><i><span id="Natural_Armor_Adj.">Natural Armor Adj.</span>:</i> The number on the table is an improvement to the mount’s existing natural armor bonus.
</p><p><i><span id="Str_Adj.">Str Adj.</span>:</i> Add this figure to the mount’s <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> score.
</p><p><i><span id="Int">Int</span>:</i> The mount’s <a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Intelligence</a> score.
</p><p><i><span id="Empathic_Link">Empathic Link</span> (<a href="SRD_Special_Abilities_Overview.html#Supernatural" title="SRD:Special Abilities Overview">Su</a>):</i> The paladin has an empathic link with her mount out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The paladin cannot see through the mount’s eyes, but they can communicate empathically.
</p><p>Note that even intelligent mounts see the world differently from humans, so misunderstandings are always possible.
</p><p>Because of this empathic link, the paladin has the same connection to an item or place that her mount does, just as with a master and his familiar (see <a href="SRD_Familiars.html" title="SRD:Familiars">Familiars</a>).
</p><p><i><span id="Improved_Evasion">Improved Evasion</span> (<a href="SRD_Special_Abilities_Overview.html#Extraordinary" title="SRD:Special Abilities Overview">Ex</a>):</i> When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a mount takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.
</p><p><i><span id="Share_Spells">Share Spells</span>:</i> At the paladin’s option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts on herself also affect her mount.
</p><p>The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the mount if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the mount again even if it returns to the paladin before the duration expires. Additionally, the paladin may cast a spell with a target of “You” on her mount (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A paladin and her mount can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the mount’s type (magical beast).
</p><p><i><span id="Share_Saving_Throws">Share Saving Throws</span>:</i> For each of its saving throws, the mount uses its own base save bonus or the paladin’s, whichever is higher. The mount applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn’t share any other bonuses on saves that the master might have.
</p><p><i><span id="Improved_Speed">Improved Speed</span> (<a href="SRD_Special_Abilities_Overview.html#Extraordinary" title="SRD:Special Abilities Overview">Ex</a>):</i> The mount’s speed increases by 10 feet.
</p><p><i><span id="Command">Command</span> (<a href="SRD_Special_Abilities_Overview.html#Spell-Like" title="SRD:Special Abilities Overview">Sp</a>):</i> Once per day per two paladin levels of its master, a mount can use this ability to command other any normal animal of approximately the same kind as itself (for warhorses and warponies, this category includes donkeys, mules, and ponies), as long as the target creature has fewer Hit Dice than the mount. This ability functions like the command spell, but the mount must make a DC 21 <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> check to succeed if it’s being ridden at the time. If the check fails, the ability does not work that time, but it still counts against the mount’s daily uses. Each target may attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin’s level + paladin’s Cha modifier) to negate the effect.
</p><p><i><span id="Spell_Resistance">Spell Resistance</span> (<a href="SRD_Special_Abilities_Overview.html#Extraordinary" title="SRD:Special Abilities Overview">Ex</a>):</i> A mount’s spell resistance equals its master’s paladin level + 5. To affect the mount with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the mount’s spell resistance.
