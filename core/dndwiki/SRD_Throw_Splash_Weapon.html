<p>A splash weapon is a ranged <a href="SRD_Weapons.html" title="SRD:Weapons">weapon</a> that breaks on impact, splashing or scattering its contents over its target and nearby creatures or objects. To attack with a splash weapon, make a ranged <a href="SRD_Touch_Attack.html" title="SRD:Touch Attack" class="mw-redirect">touch attack</a> against the target. Thrown weapons require no <a href="SRD_Weapon_Proficiency.html" title="SRD:Weapon Proficiency" class="mw-redirect">weapon proficiency</a>, so you don’t take the –4 <a href="SRD_Weapon_Proficiency.html" title="SRD:Weapon Proficiency" class="mw-redirect">nonproficiency penalty</a>. A hit deals direct hit damage to the target, and splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the target.
</p><p>You can instead target a specific grid intersection. Treat this as a <a href="SRD_Ranged_Attack.html" title="SRD:Ranged Attack" class="mw-redirect">ranged attack</a> against <a href="SRD_AC.html" title="SRD:AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a> 5. However, if you target a grid intersection, creatures in all adjacent squares are dealt the splash damage, and the direct hit damage is not dealt to any creature. (You can’t target a grid intersection occupied by a creature, such as a Large or larger creature; in this case, you’re aiming at the creature.)
</p><p>If you miss the target (whether aiming at a creature or a grid intersection), roll 1d8. This determines the misdirection of the throw, with 1 being straight back at you and 2 through 8 counting clockwise around the grid intersection or target creature. Then, count a number of squares in the indicated direction equal to the range increment of the throw.
</p><p>After you determine where the weapon landed, it deals splash damage to all creatures in adjacent squares.
