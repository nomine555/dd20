<p><em>9th-level illusion</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to one minute </p>
<p>Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Frightened</a> for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Frightened</a> creature's turns, it must succeed on a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature. </p></div>
