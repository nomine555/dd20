<p><em>4th-level transmutation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes </p>
<p>You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/scorpion/index.html">Scorpion</a> within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/giant_centipede/index.html">Giant Centipede</a>, a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/spider/index.html">Spider</a> becomes a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/giant_spider/index.html">Giant Spider</a>, a wasp becomes a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/giant_wasp/index.html">Giant Wasp</a>, and a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/scorpion/index.html">Scorpion</a> becomes a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/giant_scorpion/index.html">Giant Scorpion</a>.  <br/>
Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.  <br/>
A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.  <br/>
The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/giant_wasp/index.html">Giant Wasp</a>. </p></div>
