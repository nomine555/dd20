<strong>Challenge</strong> 5 (1,800 XP) </p>
<p><strong>Limited Telepathy.</strong> The otyugh can magically transmit simple messages and images to any creature within 120 feet of it that can understand a language. This form of telepathy doesn't allow the receiving creature to telepathically respond. </p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> The otyugh makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its tentacles.  <br/>
<strong>Bite.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw against disease or become <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Poisoned</a> until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.  <br/>
<strong>Tentacle.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Grappled</a> (escape DC 13) and <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a> until the grapple ends. The otyugh has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.  <br/>
<strong>Tentacle Slam.</strong> The otyugh slams creatures <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Grappled</a> by it into each other or a solid surface. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw or take 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and be <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Stunned</a> until the end of the otyugh's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Stunned</a>.</p></div>
