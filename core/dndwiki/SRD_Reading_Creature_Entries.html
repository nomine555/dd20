<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reading_Creature_Entries">Reading Creature Entries</span></h2>
<p>Each monster description is organized in the same general format, as outlined below. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Statistics_Block">Statistics Block</span></h3>
<p>This portion of a monster description contains basic game information on the creature.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Name"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Name_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Name (Creature Statistic)">Name</a></span></h4>
<p>This is the name by which the creature is generally known. The descriptive text may provide other names.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Size_and_Type"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Size_and_Type_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Size and Type (Creature Statistic)">Size and Type</a></span></h4>
<p>This line describes the creature’s size. A size modifier applies to the creature’s <a href="SRD_Armor_Class.html" title="SRD:Armor Class">Armor Class</a> (<a href="SRD_AC.html" title="SRD:AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a>) and <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack bonus</a>, as well as to certain <a href="SRD_Skills.html" title="SRD:Skills">skills</a>. A creature’s size also determines how far it can <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Space/Reach_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Space/Reach (Creature Statistic)">reach</a> to make a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html#Melee_Attacks" title="SRD:Standard Actions">melee attack</a> and how much space it occupies in a fight (see <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Space/Reach_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Space/Reach (Creature Statistic)">Space/Reach</a>).
</p><p>The size and type line continues with the creature’s type. Type determines how magic affects a creature. Type determines certain features, such as <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Hit_Dice_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Hit Dice (Creature Statistic)">Hit Dice</a> size, <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Attack_Bonus" title="SRD:Attack Bonus" class="mw-redirect">base attack bonus</a>, base <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> bonuses, and <a href="SRD_Skills.html" title="SRD:Skills">skill points</a>.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Hit_Dice"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Hit_Dice_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Hit Dice (Creature Statistic)">Hit Dice</a></span></h4>
<p>This line gives the creature’s number and type of Hit Dice, and lists any bonus <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>. A parenthetical note gives the average <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> for a creature of the indicated number of Hit Dice. A creature’s Hit Dice total is also treated as its level for determining how spells affect the creature, its rate of natural healing, and its maximum ranks in a skill.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Initiative"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Initiative_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Initiative (Creature Statistic)">Initiative</a></span></h4>
<p>This line gives the creature’s modifier on <a href="SRD_Initiative.html" title="SRD:Initiative">initiative checks</a>.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Speed"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Speed_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Speed (Creature Statistic)">Speed</a></span></h4>
<p>This line gives the creature’s tactical speed on land (the amount of distance it can <a href="SRD_Cover.html" title="SRD:Cover">cover</a> in one <a href="SRD_Move_Actions.html" title="SRD:Move Actions">move action</a>). If the creature wears armor that reduces its speed, the creature’s base land speed follows.
</p><p>If the creature has other modes of movement, these are given after (or in place of) the land speed. Unless noted otherwise, modes of movement are natural (not magical).
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Armor_Class">Armor Class</span></h4>
<p>The <a href="SRD_Armor_Class.html" title="SRD:Armor Class">Armor Class</a> line gives the creature’s <a href="SRD_AC.html" title="SRD:AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a> for normal combat and includes a parenthetical mention of the modifiers contributing to it (usually size, <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dexterity</a>, and <a href="SRD_Natural_Armor.html" title="SRD:Natural Armor" class="mw-redirect">natural armor</a>). The creature’s touch and <a href="SRD_Flat-Footed.html" title="SRD:Flat-Footed">flat-footed</a> ACs follow the combat-ready <a href="SRD_AC.html" title="SRD:AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a>.
</p><p>A creature’s armor proficiencies (if it has any) depend on its type, but in general a creature is automatically proficient with any kind of armor it is described as wearing (<a href="SRD_Armor_Proficiency_(Light).html" title="SRD:Armor Proficiency (Light)">light</a>, <a href="SRD_Armor_Proficiency_(Medium).html" title="SRD:Armor Proficiency (Medium)">medium</a>, or <a href="SRD_Armor_Proficiency_(Heavy).html" title="SRD:Armor Proficiency (Heavy)">heavy</a>), and with all lighter kinds of armor.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Base_Attack.2FGrapple">Base Attack/Grapple</span></h4>
<p>The number before the slash on this line is the creature’s <a href="SRD_Base_Attack_Bonus.html" title="SRD:Base Attack Bonus" class="mw-redirect">base attack bonus</a> (before any modifiers are applied). This number won’t often be used, but it can be handy sometimes, especially if the creature has the <a href="SRD_Power_Attack.html" title="SRD:Power Attack">Power Attack</a> or <a href="SRD_Combat_Expertise.html" title="SRD:Combat Expertise">Combat Expertise</a> <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a>.
</p><p>The number after the slash is the creature’s <a href="SRD_Grapple.html" title="SRD:Grapple">grapple</a> bonus, which is used when the creature makes a <a href="SRD_Grapple.html" title="SRD:Grapple">grapple attack</a> or when someone tries to <a href="SRD_Grapple.html" title="SRD:Grapple">grapple</a> the creature. The <a href="SRD_Grapple.html" title="SRD:Grapple">grapple</a> bonus includes all modifiers that apply to the creature’s <a href="SRD_Grapple.html" title="SRD:Grapple">grapple</a> checks (<a href="SRD_Base_Attack_Bonus.html" title="SRD:Base Attack Bonus" class="mw-redirect">base attack bonus</a>, <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> modifier, special size modifier, and any other applicable modifier, such as a racial bonus on <a href="SRD_Grapple.html" title="SRD:Grapple">grapple</a> checks).
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Attack"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Attack_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Attack (Creature Statistic)">Attack</a></span></h4>
<p>This line shows the single attack the creature makes with an attack action. In most cases, this is also the attack the creature uses when making an <a href="SRD_Attacks_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attacks of Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a> as well. The attack line provides the weapon used (natural or manufactured), attack bonus, and form of attack (melee or ranged). The attack bonus given includes modifications for size and <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> (for <a href="SRD_Melee_Attack.html" title="SRD:Melee Attack" class="mw-redirect">melee attacks</a>) or <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dexterity</a> (for <a href="SRD_Ranged_Attack.html" title="SRD:Ranged Attack" class="mw-redirect">ranged attacks</a>). A creature with the <a href="SRD_Weapon_Finesse.html" title="SRD:Weapon Finesse">Weapon Finesse</a> <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> can use its <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dexterity</a> modifier on <a href="SRD_Melee_Attack.html" title="SRD:Melee Attack" class="mw-redirect">melee attacks</a>. If the creature uses natural attacks, the <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Natural_Weapon" title="SRD:Natural Weapon" class="mw-redirect">natural weapon</a> given here is the creature’s primary <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Natural_Weapon" title="SRD:Natural Weapon" class="mw-redirect">natural weapon</a>. If the creature has several different weapons at its disposal, the alternatives are shown, with each different attack separated by the word “or.” A creature can use one of its secondary <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Natural_Weapon" title="SRD:Natural Weapon" class="mw-redirect">natural weapons</a> when making an attack action, but if it does it takes an attack penalty, as noted in the Full Attack section below. The damage that each attack deals is noted parenthetically. Damage from an attack is always at least 1 point, even if a subtraction from a die roll reduces the result to 0 or lower.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Full_Attack"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Full_Attack_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Full Attack (Creature Statistic)">Full Attack</a></span></h4>
<p>This line shows all the physical attacks the creature makes when it uses a <a href="SRD_Full-Round_Actions.html" title="SRD:Full-Round Actions">full-round action</a> to make a full attack. It gives the number of attacks along with the weapon, attack bonus, and form of attack (melee or ranged). The first entry is for the creature’s primary weapon, with an attack bonus including modifications for size and <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> (for <a href="SRD_Melee_Attack.html" title="SRD:Melee Attack" class="mw-redirect">melee attacks</a>) or <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dexterity</a> (for <a href="SRD_Ranged_Attack.html" title="SRD:Ranged Attack" class="mw-redirect">ranged attacks</a>). A creature with the <a href="SRD_Weapon_Finesse.html" title="SRD:Weapon Finesse">Weapon Finesse</a> <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> can use its <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dexterity</a> modifier on <a href="SRD_Melee_Attack.html" title="SRD:Melee Attack" class="mw-redirect">melee attacks</a>. The remaining weapons are secondary, and attacks with them are made with a –5 penalty to the <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack roll</a>, no matter how many there are. Creatures with the <a href="SRD_Multiattack.html" title="SRD:Multiattack">Multiattack</a> <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> take only a –2 penalty on secondary attacks. The damage that each attack deals is noted parenthetically. Damage from an attack is always at least 1 point, even if a subtraction from a die roll reduces the result to 0 or lower.
</p><p>A creature’s primary attack damage includes its full <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> modifier (1-1/2 times its <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> bonus if the attack is with the creature’s sole <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Natural_Weapon" title="SRD:Natural Weapon" class="mw-redirect">natural weapon</a>) and is given first. Secondary attacks add only 1/2 the creature’s <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> bonus and are given second in the parentheses. 
</p><p>If any attacks also have some special effect other than damage, that information is given here.
</p><p>Unless noted otherwise, creatures using <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Natural_Weapon" title="SRD:Natural Weapon" class="mw-redirect">natural weapons</a> deal double damage on <a href="SRD_Critical_Hit.html" title="SRD:Critical Hit" class="mw-redirect">critical hits</a>.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Manufactured_Weapons">Manufactured Weapons</span></h5>
<p>Creatures that use swords, bows, spears, and the like follow the same rules as characters do, including those for additional attacks from a high <a href="SRD_Base_Attack_Bonus.html" title="SRD:Base Attack Bonus" class="mw-redirect">base attack bonus</a> and two-weapon fighting penalties. This category also includes "found items," such as rocks and logs, that a creature wields in combat—in essence, any weapon that is not intrinsic to the creature. The bonus for attacks with two-handed weapons is 1-1/2 times the creature’s <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> modifier (if it is a bonus), and is given first. Off-hand weapons add only 1/2 the <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> bonus and are given second in the parentheses.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Space.2FReach"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Space/Reach_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Space/Reach (Creature Statistic)">Space/Reach</a></span></h4>
<p>This line describes how much space the creature takes up on the battle grid and thereby needs to fight effectively, as well as how close it has to be to threaten an opponent. The number before the slash is the creature’s space, or how many feet one side of the creature occupies. The number after the slash is the creature’s natural reach. If the creature has exceptional reach due to a weapon, tentacle, or the like, the extended reach and its source are noted in parentheses at the end of the line.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Special_Attacks_and_Special_Qualities"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Special_Attacks_and_Special_Qualities_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Special Attacks and Special Qualities (Creature Statistic)">Special Attacks and Special Qualities</a></span></h4>
<p>Many creatures have unusual abilities. A monster entry breaks these abilities into special attacks and special qualities. The latter category includes defenses, vulnerabilities, and other special abilities that are not modes of attack. A special ability is either <a href="SRD_Special_Abilities_Overview.html#Extraordinary" title="SRD:Special Abilities Overview">extraordinary (Ex)</a>, <a href="SRD_Special_Abilities_Overview.html#Spell-Like" title="SRD:Special Abilities Overview">spell-like (Sp)</a>, or <a href="SRD_Special_Abilities_Overview.html#Supernatural" title="SRD:Special Abilities Overview">supernatural (Su)</a>. Additional information (when needed) is provided in the creature’s descriptive text.
</p><p>When a special ability allows a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a>, the kind of save and the save <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> is noted in the descriptive text. Most <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throws</a> against special abilities have <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DCs</a> calculated as follows: 10 + 1/2 the attacker’s racial <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">Hit Dice</a> + the relevant ability modifier.
</p><p>The save <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> is given in the creature’s description along with the ability on which the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> is based.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Creatures_with_Psi-Like_Abilities">Creatures with Psi-Like Abilities</span></h5>
<p>Each of a creature’s <a href="SRD_Psi-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Psi-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">psi-like abilities</a> has a <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>. Each ability that allows a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> also gives a save <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> in parentheses following the power name.
</p><p><a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">Powers</a> that have increased effects due to augmentation include information about the effect. An asterisk indicates that the power has already been augmented by the creature’s innate ability.
</p><p><a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">Powers</a> that can’t be augmented, or that are manifested at their normal minimum level, do not contain any special notations. Resolve the effect of manifesting the power without augmentation at the creature’s given <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>.
</p><p>Some creatures may have particular <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> that are manifested at a higher or lower level than their normal <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>. In such cases, the <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a> is given in the parenthetical information following the power name.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Saves"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Saves_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Saves (Creature Statistic)">Saves</a></span></h4>
<p>This line gives the creature’s <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html#Fortitude" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a>, <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html#Reflex" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a>, and <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html#Will" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Will</a> save modifiers.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Abilities"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Abilities_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Abilities (Creature Statistic)">Abilities</a></span></h4>
<p>This line lists the creature’s ability scores, in the customary order: <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Str</a>, <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dex</a>, <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Con</a>, <a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Int</a>, <a href="SRD_Wisdom.html" title="SRD:Wisdom">Wis</a>, <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Cha</a>. Except where noted otherwise, each creature is assumed to have the standard array of ability scores before racial adjustments (all 11s and 10s). To determine any creature’s racial ability adjustments, subtract 10 from any even-numbered <a href="SRD_Ability_Scores.html" title="SRD:Ability Scores">ability score</a> and subtract 11 from any odd-numbered score. (Exceptions are noted in the Combat section of a creature’s descriptive text.) 
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Strength"><a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a></span></h5>
<p>Quadrupeds can carry heavier loads than bipeds can. Any creature with four or more motive limbs can carry a load as a quadruped, even if it does not necessarily use all the limbs at once.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Intelligence"><a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Intelligence</a></span></h5>
<p>A creature can speak all the languages mentioned in its description, plus one additional language per point of <a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Intelligence</a> bonus. Any creature with an <a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Intelligence</a> score of 3 or higher understands at least one language (Common, unless noted otherwise).
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Nonabilities"><a href="SRD_Ability_Scores.html#Nonabilities" title="SRD:Ability Scores">Nonabilities</a></span></h5>
<p>Some creatures lack certain ability scores. These creatures do not have an <a href="SRD_Ability_Scores.html" title="SRD:Ability Scores">ability score</a> of 0—they lack the ability altogether. The modifier for a nonability is +0.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Skills"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Skills_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Skills (Creature Statistic)">Skills</a></span></h4>
<p>This line gives the creature’s skills, along with each skill’s modifier (including adjustments for ability scores, armor check penalties, and any bonuses from <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a> or racial traits). All listed skills are <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> skills, unless the creature has a <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">character class</a> (noted in the entry). A creature’s type and <a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Intelligence</a> score determine the number of <a href="SRD_Skill_Points.html" title="SRD:Skill Points" class="mw-redirect">skill points</a> it has.
</p><p>The Skills section of the creature’s description recaps racial bonuses and other adjustments to skill modifiers for the sake of clarity; these bonuses should not be added to the listed skill modifiers.
</p><p>An asterisk (*) beside the relevant score and in the Skills section of the descriptive text indicates a conditional adjustment, one that applies only in certain situations.

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Natural_Tendencies">Natural Tendencies</span></h5>
<p>Some creatures simply aren’t made for certain types of physical activity. If it seems clear that a particular creature simply is not made for a particular physical activity, that creature takes a –8 penalty on <a href="SRD_Skill_Check.html" title="SRD:Skill Check" class="mw-redirect">skill checks</a> that defy its natural tendencies.
</p><p>In extreme circumstances the creature fails the check automatically.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Feats"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Feats_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Feats (Creature Statistic)">Feats</a></span></h4>
<p>The line gives the creature’s <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a>. A monster gains <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a> just as a character does. Sometimes a creature has one or more bonus <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a>, marked with a superscript B (<sup>B</sup>). Creatures often do not have the prerequisites for a bonus <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>. If this is so, the creature can still use the <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>. If you wish to customize the creature with new <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a>, you can reassign its other <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a>, but not its bonus <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a>. A creature cannot have a <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> that is not a bonus <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> unless it has the <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>’s prerequisites.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Environment"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Environment_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Environment (Creature Statistic)">Environment</a></span></h4>
<p>This line gives a type of climate and terrain where the creature is typically found. This describes a tendency, but is not exclusionary.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Organization"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Organization_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Organization (Creature Statistic)">Organization</a></span></h4>
<p>This line describes the kinds of groups the creature might form. A range of numbers in parentheses indicates how many combat-ready adults are in each type of group. Many groups also have a number of noncombatants, expressed as a percentage of the fighting population. Noncombatants can include young, the infirm, slaves, or other individuals who are not inclined to fight. If the organization line contains the term “domesticated,” the creature is generally found only in the company of other creatures, whom it serves in some capacity.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Challenge_Rating"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Challenge_Rating_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Challenge Rating (Creature Statistic)">Challenge Rating</a></span></h4>
<p>This shows the average level of a party of adventurers for which one creature would make an encounter of moderate difficulty.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Treasure"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Treasure_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Treasure (Creature Statistic)">Treasure</a></span></h4>
<p>This entry in a monster description describes how much wealth a creature owns. In most cases, a creature keeps valuables in its home or lair and has no treasure with it when it travels. Intelligent creatures that own useful, portable treasure (such as magic items) tend to carry and use these, leaving bulky items at home. Treasure can include coins, goods, and items. Creatures can have varying amounts of each, as follows.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Standard">Standard</span></h5>
<p>Refer to the treasure tables and roll d% once for each type of treasure (Coins, Goods, Items) on the Level section of the table that corresponds to the creature’s Challenge Rating (for groups of creatures, use the Encounter Level for the encounter instead). Some creatures have double, triple, or even quadruple standard treasure; in these cases, roll for each type of treasure two, three, or four times.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="None">None</span></h5>
<p>The creature collects no treasure of its own.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Nonstandard">Nonstandard</span></h5>
<p>Some creatures have quirks or habits that affect the types of treasure they collect. These creatures use the same
treasure tables, but with special adjustments.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Fractional_Coins">Fractional Coins</span></h5>
<p>Roll on the Coins column in the section corresponding to the creature’s Challenge Rating, but divide the result as indicated.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id=".25_Goods_or_Items">% Goods or Items</span></h5>
<p>The creature has goods or items only some of the time. Before checking for goods or items, roll d% against the given percentage. On a success, make a normal roll on the appropriate Goods or Items column (which may still result in no goods or items).
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Double_Goods_or_Items">Double Goods or Items</span></h5>
<p>Roll twice on the appropriate Goods or Items column.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Parenthetical_Notes">Parenthetical Notes</span></h5>
<p>Some entries for goods or items include notes that limit the types of treasure a creature collects.
</p><p>When a note includes the word “no,” it means the creature does not collect or cannot keep that thing. If a random roll generates such a result, treat the result as “none” instead.
</p><p>When a note includes the word “only,” the creature goes out of its way to collect treasure of the indicated type. Treat all results from that column as the indicated type of treasure.
</p><p>It’s sometimes necessary to reroll until the right sort of item appears.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Alignment"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Alignment_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Alignment (Creature Statistic)">Alignment</a></span></h4>
<p>This line gives the <a href="SRD_Alignment.html" title="SRD:Alignment">alignment</a> that the creature is most likely to have. Every entry includes a qualifier that indicates how broadly that alignment applies to the species as a whole.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Advancement"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Advancement_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Advancement (Creature Statistic)">Advancement</a></span></h4>
<p>The monster entry usually describes only the most commonly encountered version of a creature. The advancement line shows <a href="SRD_Improving_Creatures.html" title="SRD:Improving Creatures">how tough a creature can get</a>, in terms of extra <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">Hit Dice</a>. (This is not an absolute limit, but exceptions are extremely rare.) Often, intelligent creatures advance by gaining a level in a character <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> instead of just gaining a new <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">Hit Die</a>.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Level_Adjustment"><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Level_Adjustment_(Creature_Statistic)" title="SRD:Level Adjustment (Creature Statistic)">Level Adjustment</a></span></h4>
<p>This line is included in the entries of creatures suitable for use as player characters or as cohorts (usually creatures with <a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Intelligence</a> scores of at least 3 and possessing opposable thumbs). Add this number to the creature’s total <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">Hit Dice</a>, including <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">class levels</a>, to get the creature’s effective character level (ECL). A character’s ECL affects the experience the character earns, the amount of experience the character must have before gaining a new level, and the character’s starting equipment.
