<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Psicrystals">Psicrystals</span></h4>
<p>A psicrystal is a fragment of a psionic character’s personality, brought into physical form and a semblance of life (via the <strong class="selflink">Psicrystal Affinity</strong> <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>). A psicrystal appears as a crystalline <a href="SRD_Construct_Type.html" title="SRD:Construct Type">construct</a> about the size of a human hand.
</p><p>Because it is an extension of its creator’s personality, a character’s psicrystal is in some ways a part of him. That’s why, for example, a psionic character can manifest a personal range power on his psicrystal even though normally he can manifest such a power only on himself.
</p><p>A psicrystal is treated as a <a href="SRD_Construct_Type.html" title="SRD:Construct Type">construct</a> for the purposes of all effects that depend on its type.
</p><p>A psicrystal grants special abilities to its owner, as shown on the <a href="#Psicrystal_Special_Abilities">Psicrystal Special Abilities</a> table below. In addition, a psicrystal has a personality (being a fragment of the owner’s personality), which gives its owner a bonus on certain types of checks or <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throws</a>, as given on the <a href="#Psicrystal_Personalities">Psicrystal Personalities</a> table below. These special abilities and bonuses apply only when the owner and the psicrystal are within 1 mile of each other.
</p><p>Psicrystal abilities are based on the owner’s levels in psionic <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">classes</a>. Levels from other <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">classes</a> do not count toward the owner’s level for purposes of psicrystal abilities.
</p><p>A psicrystal can speak one language of its owner’s choice (so long as it is a language the owner knows). A psicrystal can understand all other languages known by its owner, but cannot speak them. This is a <a href="SRD_Supernatural_Ability.html" title="SRD:Supernatural Ability" class="mw-redirect">supernatural ability</a>.

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Psicrystal_Basics">Psicrystal Basics</span></h5>
<p>Use the statistics for a <a href="SRD_Psicrystal.html" title="SRD:Psicrystal">psicrystal</a>, but make the following changes.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Saving_Throws">Saving Throws</span></h6>
<p>A psicrystal uses its owner’s base <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> bonuses and ability modifiers on saves, though it doesn’t enjoy any other bonuses its owner might have (from magic items or <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a>, for example).
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Abilities">Abilities</span></h6>
<p>When its self-propulsion ability is not activated, a psicrystal has no <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> score and no <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dexterity</a> score.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Skills">Skills</span></h6>
<p>A psicrystal has the same skill ranks as its owner, except that it has a minimum of 4 ranks each in <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html" title="SRD:Spot Skill">Spot</a>, <a href="SRD_Listen_Skill.html" title="SRD:Listen Skill">Listen</a>, <a href="SRD_Move_Silently_Skill.html" title="SRD:Move Silently Skill">Move Silently</a>, and <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html" title="SRD:Search Skill">Search</a>. (Even if its owner has no ranks in these skills, a psicrystal has 4 ranks in each.) A psicrystal uses its own ability modifiers on <a href="SRD_Skill_Check.html" title="SRD:Skill Check" class="mw-redirect">skill checks</a>.

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Psicrystal_Ability_Descriptions">Psicrystal Ability Descriptions</span></h5>
<p>All psicrystals have special abilities (or impart abilities to their owners) depending on the level of the owner, as shown on the table above. The abilities on the table are cumulative.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Natural_Armor_Adj._.28Ex.29">Natural Armor Adj. (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ex" title="SRD:Ex" class="mw-redirect">Ex</a>)</span></h6>
<p>This number noted here is an improvement to the psicrystal’s <a href="SRD_Natural_Armor_Bonus.html" title="SRD:Natural Armor Bonus" class="mw-redirect">natural armor bonus</a> (normally 0). It represents a psicrystal’s preternatural durability.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Intelligence_Adj._.28Ex.29"><a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Intelligence</a> Adj. (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ex" title="SRD:Ex" class="mw-redirect">Ex</a>)</span></h6>
<p>Add this value to the psicrystal’s <a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Intelligence</a> score. Psicrystals are as smart as people (though not necessarily as smart as smart people).
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Alertness_.28Ex.29"><a href="SRD_Alertness.html" title="SRD:Alertness">Alertness</a> (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ex" title="SRD:Ex" class="mw-redirect">Ex</a>)</span></h6>
<p>The presence of a psicrystal sharpens its master’s senses. While a psicrystal is within arm’s reach (adjacent to or in the same square as its owner), its owner gains the <a href="SRD_Alertness.html" title="SRD:Alertness">Alertness</a> <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Improved_Evasion_.28Ex.29">Improved Evasion (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ex" title="SRD:Ex" class="mw-redirect">Ex</a>)</span></h6>
<p>If a psicrystal is subjected to an attack that normally allows a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> and half damage even if the <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> fails.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Personality_.28Ex.29">Personality (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ex" title="SRD:Ex" class="mw-redirect">Ex</a>)</span></h6>
<p>Every psicrystal has a personality. See Psicrystal Personality, below.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Self-Propulsion_.28Su.29">Self-Propulsion (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Su" title="SRD:Su" class="mw-redirect">Su</a>)</span></h6>
<p>As a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>, its owner can will a psicrystal to form spidery, ectoplasmic legs that grant the psicrystal a land speed of 30 feet and a climb speed of 20 feet. The legs fade into nothingness after one day (or sooner, if the owner desires).
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Share_Powers_.28Su.29">Share <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">Powers</a> (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Su" title="SRD:Su" class="mw-redirect">Su</a>)</span></h6>
<p>At the owner’s option, he can have any power (but not any <a href="SRD_Psi-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Psi-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">psi-like ability</a>) he manifests on himself also affect his psicrystal. The psicrystal must be within 5 feet of him at the time of the manifestation to receive the benefit. If the power has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the psicrystal if it moves farther than 5 feet away, and will not affect the psicrystal again, even if it returns to its owner before the duration expires.
</p><p>Additionally, the owner can manifest a power with a target of “You” on his psicrystal (as a touch range power) instead of on himself. The owner and psicrystal cannot share <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> if the <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> normally do not affect creatures of the psicrystal’s type (<a href="SRD_Construct_Type.html" title="SRD:Construct Type">construct</a>).
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Sighted_.28Ex.29">Sighted (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ex" title="SRD:Ex" class="mw-redirect">Ex</a>)</span></h6>
<p>Although it has no physical sensory organs, a psicrystal can telepathically sense its environment as well as a creature with normal vision and hearing. Darkness (even supernatural darkness) is irrelevant, as are areas of supernatural silence, though a psicrystal still can’t discern <a href="SRD_Invisible.html" title="SRD:Invisible">invisible</a> or ethereal beings. A psicrystal’s sighted range is 40 feet.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Telepathic_Link_.28Su.29">Telepathic Link (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Su" title="SRD:Su" class="mw-redirect">Su</a>)</span></h6>
<p>The owner has a telepathic link with his psicrystal out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The owner cannot see through the psicrystal’s senses, but the two of them can communicate telepathically as if the psicrystal were the target of a <i>mindlink</i> power manifested by the owner. For instance, a psicrystal placed in a distant room could relay the activities occurring in that room.
</p><p>Because of the telepathic link between a psicrystal and its owner, the owner has the same connection to an item or place that the psicrystal does. For instance, if his psicrystal has seen a room, the owner can teleport into that room as if he has seen it too.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Deliver_Touch_Powers_.28Su.29">Deliver Touch <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">Powers</a> (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Su" title="SRD:Su" class="mw-redirect">Su</a>)</span></h6>
<p>If the owner is 3rd level or higher, his psicrystal can deliver touch <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> for him. If the owner and psicrystal are in contact at the time the owner manifests a touch power, he can designate his psicrystal as the “toucher.” The psicrystal can then deliver the touch power just as the owner could. As usual, if the owner manifests another power before the touch is delivered, the touch power dissipates.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Telepathic_Speech_.28Ex.29">Telepathic Speech (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ex" title="SRD:Ex" class="mw-redirect">Ex</a>)</span></h6>
<p>If the owner is 5th level or higher, the psicrystal can communicate telepathically with any creature that has a language and is within 30 feet of the psicrystal, while the psicrystal is also within 1 mile of the owner.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Flight_.28Su.29">Flight (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Su" title="SRD:Su" class="mw-redirect">Su</a>)</span></h6>
<p>If the owner is 9th level or higher, he can, as a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>, will his psicrystal to fly at a speed of 50 feet (poor). The psicrystal drifts gently to the ground after one day (or sooner, if the owner desires).
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Power_Resistance_.28Ex.29">Power Resistance (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ex" title="SRD:Ex" class="mw-redirect">Ex</a>)</span></h6>
<p>If the owner is 11th level or higher, the psicrystal gains power resistance equal to the owner’s level + 5. To affect the psicrystal with a power, another manifester must get a result on a <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a> check that equals or exceeds the psicrystal’s power resistance.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Sight_Link_.28Sp.29">Sight Link (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Sp" title="SRD:Sp" class="mw-redirect">Sp</a>)</span></h6>
<p>If the owner is 13th level or higher, the character can remote view the psicrystal (as if manifesting the <i>remote view</i> power) once per day.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Channel_Power_.28Sp.29">Channel Power (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Sp" title="SRD:Sp" class="mw-redirect">Sp</a>)</span></h6>
<p>If the owner is 15th level or higher, he can manifest <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> through the psicrystal to a distance of up to 1 mile. The psicrystal is treated as the power’s originator, and all ranges are calculated from its location.
</p><p>When channeling a power through his psicrystal, the owner manifests the power by paying its <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power point</a> cost. He is still subject to <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a> and other hazards of manifesting a power, if applicable (for instance, he becomes visible when manifesting an offensive power if <i><a href="SRD_Invisible.html" title="SRD:Invisible">invisible</a></i>, as does the psicrystal).
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Psicrystal_Power"><a href="SRD_Psicrystal_Power.html" title="SRD:Psicrystal Power">Psicrystal Power</a></span></h6>
<p>When the owner reaches 21st level, and every 10 levels after, the psicrystal gains the benefit of the <a href="SRD_Psicrystal_Power.html" title="SRD:Psicrystal Power">Psicrystal Power</a> epic <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> for the power its master chooses.

<p>Each psicrystal has a distinct personality, chosen by its owner at the time of its creation from among those given on the following table. At 1st level, its owner typically gets a feel for a psicrystal’s personality only through occasional impulses, but as the owner increases in level the psicrystal’s personality becomes more pronounced. At higher levels, it is not uncommon for a psicrystal to constantly ply its owner with observations and advice, often severely slanted toward the psicrystal’s particular worldview. The owner always sees a bit of himself in his psicrystal, even if magnified and therefore distorted.
