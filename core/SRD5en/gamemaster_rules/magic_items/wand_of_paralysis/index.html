<p><em>Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)</em> </p>
<p>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a thin blue ray to streak from the tip toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw or be <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Paralyzed</a> for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.  <br/>
The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed. </p></div>
