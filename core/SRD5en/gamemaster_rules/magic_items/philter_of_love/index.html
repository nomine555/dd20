<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="philter-of-love">Philter of Love</h1>
<p><em>Potion, uncommon</em> </p>
<p>The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a> by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a>. This potion's rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart. </p></div>
