<p><b>Benefit:</b> The deity knows when anyone (other than a deity of equal or higher rank) deliberately lies. This ability works like the <i><a href="SRD_Discern_Lies.html" title="SRD:Discern Lies">discern lies</a> </i>spell, except that it works continuously and applies to any creature the deity can perceive. The deity also can enchant creatures so they become truthful. The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity’s line of sight when first affected. The enchanted creatures become unable to utter any deliberate falsehoods or evasions of truth for one day. The subject is allowed a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Will</a> save (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 10 + the deity’s <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a> modifier + the deity’s divine rank) to resist. Subjects who make successful saves become immune to this ability for one day.
