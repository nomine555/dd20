<p>Some creatures have vulnerability to a certain kind of energy effect (typically either cold or fire). Such a creature takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from the effect, regardless of whether a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.
