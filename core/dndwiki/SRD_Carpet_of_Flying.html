<p><b>Carpet of Flying:</b> This rug is able to fly through the air as if affected by an <i><a href="SRD_Overland_Flight.html" title="SRD:Overland Flight">overland flight</a> </i>spell of unlimited duration. The size, carrying capacity, and speed of the different <i>carpets of flying </i>are shown on the table below. Beautifully and intricately made, each carpet has its own command word to activate itâ€”if the device is within voice range, the command word activates it, whether the speaker is on the rug or not. The carpet is then controlled by spoken directions.
