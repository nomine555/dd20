<p><b>Benefit:</b> The deity points to any mortal within the deity’s sensory range and snuffs out its life. There must be an unbroken line of effect between the deity and the target.
</p><p><b>Notes:</b> This ability works like the <i><a href="SRD_Destruction.html" title="SRD:Destruction">destruction</a> </i>spell, except that there is no material component. The mortal is allowed a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> with a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> of 20 + the deity’s <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a> bonus + the deity’s divine rank. Even if the save succeeds, the subject takes 10d6 points of damage, which may kill it anyway. If the attack kills the mortal (either through a failed <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> or through damage), the mortal cannot be <a href="SRD_Raise_Dead.html" title="SRD:Raise Dead">raised</a> or <a href="SRD_Resurrection.html" title="SRD:Resurrection">resurrected</a> afterward, except by a deity of equal or higher rank using the <a href="SRD_Gift_Of_Life_(Divine_Ability).html" title="SRD:Gift Of Life (Divine Ability)">Gift of Life</a>, <a href="SRD_Life_And_Death_(Divine_Ability).html" title="SRD:Life And Death (Divine Ability)">Life and Death</a>, or <a href="SRD_Mass_Life_And_Death_(Divine_Ability).html" title="SRD:Mass Life And Death (Divine Ability)">Mass Life and Death</a> salient divine ability.
