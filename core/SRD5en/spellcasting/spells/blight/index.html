<p><em>4th-level necromancy</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p>Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.  <br/>
If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a>, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.  <br/>
If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies. </p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th. </p></div>
