<p><b>Arrow Catching:</b> A shield with this ability attracts ranged weapons to it. It has a deflection bonus of +1 against ranged weapons because projectiles and thrown weapons veer toward it. Additionally, any projectile or thrown weapon aimed at a target within 5 feet of the shield’s wearer diverts from its original target and targets the shield’s bearer instead. (If the wielder has total <a href="SRD_Cover.html" title="SRD:Cover">cover</a> relative to the attacker, the projectile or thrown weapon is not diverted.) Additionally, those attacking the wearer with ranged weapons ignore any miss chances that would normally apply. Projectiles and thrown weapons that have an enhancement bonus higher than the shield’s base <a href="SRD_AC.html" title="SRD:AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a> bonus are not diverted to the wearer (but the shield’s increased <a href="SRD_AC.html" title="SRD:AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a> bonus still applies against these weapons). The wielder can activate or deactivate this ability with a command word.
