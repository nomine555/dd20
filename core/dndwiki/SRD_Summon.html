<p>A creature with the <i>summon</i> ability can summon specific other creatures of its kind much as though casting a <a href="SRD_Summon_Monster_I.html" title="SRD:Summon Monster I"><i>summon monster</i></a> spell, but it usually has only a limited chance of success (as specified in the creatureâ€™s entry). Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons. Summoned creatures automatically return whence they came after 1 hour. A creature that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. Most creatures with the ability to summon do not use it lightly, since it leaves them beholden to the summoned creature. In general, they use it only when necessary to save their own lives. An appropriate <a href="SRD_Spell_Level.html" title="SRD:Spell Level" class="mw-redirect">spell level</a> is given for each summoning ability for purposes of <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> checks and attempts to dispel the summoned creature. No experience points are awarded for summoned monsters.
