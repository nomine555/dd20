<p>The character can use song or poetics to hinder enemy spellcasters within a 30-foot spread from the character. To successfully cast a spell within this area, a spellcaster must make a <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> check as if he or she were casting defensively, and all such checks have a penalty equal to half the character’s level. The character can choose to exclude any characters from this effect. The character may sing, play, or recite a hindering song while taking other mundane actions, but not magical ones (see the <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a>’s inspire courage ability for more details). The character may keep up the hindering song for a maximum of 10 rounds. Using the hindering song counts as one of the character’s uses of song or poetics for the day.
