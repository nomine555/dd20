<h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">Pedestal of Reading</h1>

<div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><p><b>Pedestal of Reading:</b> This ornate pedestal is crafted from a mix of the highest quality woods with carvings of scribes hard at work covering every surface. The magic of this pedestal becomes evident when a book written in a language unknown to the owner is placed on top of the pedestal. After a few moments a murmuring sound can be heard coming from the engravings of the scribes, the murmuring reaches a crescendo after two rounds and the book is suddenly translated into a language that the pedestal owner understands. This change remains until the book is removed from the pedestal. Magical books cannot be translated in this manner and actually cause the pedestal to scream as if in pain until removed from the pedestal and for 2 rounds afterwards. It takes twenty-four hours for the pedestal to attune to a new owner, during which time the new owner must remain within 30 feet of the pedestal.
