<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet  <br/>

<p>For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Deafened</a> while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.</p></div>
