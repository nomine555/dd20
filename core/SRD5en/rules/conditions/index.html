<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="conditions">Conditions</h1>
<p>Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.  <br/>
A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.  <br/>
If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.  <br/>
The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition. </p>
<h3 id="blinded">Blinded</h3>
<ul>
<li>A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.</li>
<li>Attack rolls against the creature have <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a>, and the creature's attack rolls have <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a>. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="charmed">Charmed</h3>
<ul>
<li>A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.</li>
<li>The charmer has <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a> on any ability check to interact socially with the creature. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deafened">Deafened</h3>
<ul>
<li>A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exhaustion">Exhaustion</h3>
<p>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description. </p>

<p>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.  <br/>
A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> on ability checks.  <br/>
An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.  <br/>
Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. </p>
