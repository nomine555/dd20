<p><em>Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)</em> </p>
<p>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/web/index.html">Web</a></em></strong> spell (save DC 15) from it.  <br/>
The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.</p></div>
