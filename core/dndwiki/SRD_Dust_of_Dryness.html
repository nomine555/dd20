<p><b>Dust of Dryness:</b> This special dust has many uses. If it is thrown into water, a volume of as much as 100 gallons is instantly transformed to nothingness, and the dust becomes a marble-sized pellet, floating or resting where it was thrown. If this pellet is hurled down, it breaks and releases the same volume of water. The dust affects only water (fresh, salt, alkaline), not other liquids.
</p><p>If the dust is employed against an <a href="SRD_Water_Elemental.html" title="SRD:Water Elemental">elemental with the water subtype</a>, the creature must make a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 18 <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save or be destroyed.
