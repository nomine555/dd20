<p><em>Potion, uncommon</em> </p>
<p>When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/enlargereduce/index.html">Enlarge/Reduce</a></em></strong> spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process. </p></div>
