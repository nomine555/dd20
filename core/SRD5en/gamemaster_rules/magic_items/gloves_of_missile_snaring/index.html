<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em> </p>
<p>These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When a ranged weapon attack hits you while you're wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> modifier, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand. </p></div>
