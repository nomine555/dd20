<p>A creature attacking with a breath weapon is actually expelling something from its mouth (rather than conjuring it by means of a spell or some other magical effect). A breath weapon attack usually deals damage and is often based on some type of energy.
</p><p>Such breath weapons allow a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> save for half damage (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 10 + 1/2 breathing creature’s racial <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">HD</a> + breathing creature’s <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Con</a> modifier; the exact <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> is given in the creature’s descriptive text). Some breath weapons allow a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save or a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Will</a> save instead of a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> save. Most creatures with breath weapons are limited to a number of uses per day or by a minimum length of time that must pass between uses. Such creatures are usually smart enough to save their breath weapon until they really need it.

</li>
<li> No <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack roll</a> is necessary. The breath simply fills its stated area.
</li>
<li> Any character caught in the area must make the appropriate <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> or suffer the breath weapon’s full effect. In many cases, a character who succeeds on his <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> still takes half damage or some other reduced effect.

<li> Breath weapons are <a href="SRD_Supernatural_Ability.html" title="SRD:Supernatural Ability" class="mw-redirect">supernatural abilities</a> except where noted.

<li> Creatures are immune to their own breath weapons unless otherwise noted.

<li> Creatures unable to breathe can still use breath weapons. (The term is something of a misnomer.)
