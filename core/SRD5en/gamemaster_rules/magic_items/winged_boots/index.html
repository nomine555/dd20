<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em> </p>
<p>While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/index.html#fly">Fly</a> for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.  <br/>
The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they aren't in use. </p></div>
