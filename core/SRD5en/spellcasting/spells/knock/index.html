<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="knock">Knock</h1>
<p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p>Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.  <br/>
A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.  <br/>
If you choose a target that is held shut with <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/arcane_lock/index.html">Arcane Lock</a></em></strong>, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.  <br/>
When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.</p></div>
