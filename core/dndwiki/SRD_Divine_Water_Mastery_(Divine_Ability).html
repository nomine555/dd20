<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Water_Domain" title="SRD:Water Domain">Water domain</a>.
</p><p><b>Benefit:</b> The deity gains a competence bonus on attack, damage, and <a href="SRD_Armor_Class.html" title="SRD:Armor Class">Armor Class</a> equal to its divine rank if both the deity and its foe are touching the same body of water.
</p><p>The deity gains a swim speed commensurate with its size (see Divine Characteristics).
</p><p>At will, as a <a href="SRD_Full-Round_Actions.html" title="SRD:Full-Round Actions">full-round action</a>, the deity can create a devastating tidal wave of water. On land, the wave has effects similar to a flash flood: Creatures caught in the water must make a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15). Large or smaller creatures that fail the save are swept away, taking 1d6 points of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> (1d3 points on a successful <a href="SRD_Swim_Skill.html" title="SRD:Swim Skill">Swim</a> check against <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 20). Huge creatures that fail are <a href="SRD_Knocked_Down.html" title="SRD:Knocked Down">knocked down</a>, while Gargantuan and Colossal creatures are <a href="SRD_Checked.html" title="SRD:Checked">checked</a>. The wave destroys all wooden buildings and 25% of the stone buildings it comes into contact with. At sea, the tidal wave capsizes ships and crushes them to splinters. The wave affects a number of miles of coastland up to the deityâ€™s divine rank. 
</p><p>When touching water, the deity can automatically sense the location of anything within 10 feet per divine rank that is in contact with the same body of water.
