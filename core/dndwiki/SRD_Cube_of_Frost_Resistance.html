<p><b>Cube of Frost Resistance:</b> This cube is activated or deactivated by pressing one side. When activated, it creates a cube-shaped area 10 feet on a side centered on the possessor (or on the cube itself, if the item is later placed on a surface). The temperature within this area is always at least 65&#176;F. The field absorbs all cold-based attacks. However, if the field is subjected to more than 50 points of cold damage in 1 <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> (from one or multiple attacks), it collapses into its portable form and cannot be reactivated for 1 hour. If the field absorbs more than 100 points of cold damage in a 10-round period, the cube is destroyed.
