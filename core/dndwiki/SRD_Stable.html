<p>A character who was <a href="SRD_Dying.html" title="SRD:Dying">dying</a> but who has stopped losing <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> and still has negative <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> is stable. The character is no longer <a href="SRD_Dying.html" title="SRD:Dying">dying</a>, but is still <a href="SRD_Unconscious.html" title="SRD:Unconscious">unconscious</a>. If the character has become stable because of aid from another character (such as a <a href="SRD_Heal_Skill.html" title="SRD:Heal Skill">Heal check</a> or magical healing), then the character no longer loses <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>. He has a 10% chance each hour of becoming conscious and <a href="SRD_Disabled.html" title="SRD:Disabled">disabled</a> (even though his <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> are still negative). 
</p><p>If the character became stable on his own and hasnâ€™t had help, he is still at risk of losing <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>. Each hour, he has a 10% chance of becoming conscious and <a href="SRD_Disabled.html" title="SRD:Disabled">disabled</a>. Otherwise he loses 1 hit point.
