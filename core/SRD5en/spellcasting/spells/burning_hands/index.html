<p><em>1st-level evocation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Self (15-foot cone) <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p>As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  <br/>
The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. </p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p></div>
