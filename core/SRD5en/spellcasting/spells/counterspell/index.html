<p><em>3rd-level abjuration</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> S  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p>You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/index.html#spellcasting">Spellcasting</a> ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect. </p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.</p></div>
