<p>A black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> until the spell ends.  <br/>
At the end of each of the target's turns, it can make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw against the spell. On a success, the spell ends. </p></div>
