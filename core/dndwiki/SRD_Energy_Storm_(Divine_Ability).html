<p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Divine rank 11.
</p><p><b>Benefit:</b> The deity can surround itself with a vortex of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic, positive, or negative energy, specified in the deityâ€™s description). The vortex extends from the deity in an emanation with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank. The effect stops attacks with thrown weapons and projectiles. Such attacks fail if made by creatures inside the area, or targeted at creatures within the area, or if their paths take them through the area.
</p><p>Energy storms that use acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic energy deal 1 point of energy damage and 1 point of holy damage per divine rank each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>.
