<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  <br/>
You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Poisoned</a> for 1 minute. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn. </p></div>
