<p><em>2nd-level illusion</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Self <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute   </p>
<p>Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you. For the duration, any creature has <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn't rely on sight, as with <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/index.html#blindsight">Blindsight</a>, or can see through illusions, as with <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/index.html#truesight">Truesight</a>. </p></div>
