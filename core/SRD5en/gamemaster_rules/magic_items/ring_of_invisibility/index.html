<p>While wearing this ring, you can turn <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Invisible</a> as an action. Anything you are wearing or carrying is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Invisible</a> with you. You remain <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Invisible</a> until the ring is removed, until you attack or cast a spell, or until you use a bonus action to become visible again. </p></div>
