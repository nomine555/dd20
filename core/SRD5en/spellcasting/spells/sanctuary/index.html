<p><em>1st-level abjuration</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small silver mirror)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute </p>
<p>You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.  <br/>
If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends. </p></div>
