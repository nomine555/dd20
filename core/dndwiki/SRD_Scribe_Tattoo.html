<p>You can create psionic tattoos, which store <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> within their designs.

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Prerequisite">Prerequisite</span></h5>
<p><a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">Manifester level</a> 3rd.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Benefit">Benefit</span></h5>
<p>You can create a <a href="SRD_Psionic_Tatoos.html" title="SRD:Psionic Tatoos">psionic tattoo</a> of any power of 3rd level or lower that you know and that targets one or more creatures. Scribing a psionic tattoo takes one day. When you create a psionic tattoo, you set the <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>. The <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a> must be sufficient to manifest the power in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a psionic tattoo is its power level &#215; its <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a> &#215; 50 gp. To scribe a tattoo, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials (special inks, masterwork needles, and so on) costing one-half of this base price.
</p><p>When you create a psionic tattoo, you make any choices that you would normally make when manifesting the power.
</p><p>When its wearer physically activates the tattoo, the wearer is the target of the power.
</p><p>Any psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must pay the XP when creating the tattoo.
