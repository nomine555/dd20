<p>This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.   <br/>
<strong>Acid.</strong> As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.  <br/>
<strong>Alchemist's Fire.</strong> This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> check to extinguish the flames.  <br/>
<strong>Antitoxin.</strong> A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a> on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.  <br/>
<strong>Arcane Focus.</strong> An arcane focus is a special item--an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item--designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/index.html#spellcasting">Spellcasting</a> focus.  <br/>
<strong>Ball Bearings.</strong> As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/combat/cover/index.html">Cover</a> a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw or fall <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Prone</a>. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.  <br/>
<strong>Block and Tackle.</strong> A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.  <br/>
<strong>Book.</strong> A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).  <br/>
<strong>Caltrops.</strong> As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/combat/cover/index.html">Cover</a> a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature's walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.  <br/>
<strong>Candle.</strong> For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. <br/>
<strong>Case, Crossbow Bolt.</strong> This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts. <br/>
<strong>Case, Map or Scroll.</strong> This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.  <br/>
<strong>Chain.</strong> A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> check. <br/>
<strong>Climber's Kit.</strong> A climber's kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber's kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can't fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can't <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/index.html#climb">Climb</a> more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor. <br/>
<strong>Component Pouch.</strong> A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description). <br/>
<strong>Crowbar.</strong> Using a crowbar grants <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a> to <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> checks where the crowbar's leverage can be applied. <br/>
<strong>Druidic Focus.</strong> A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/druid/index.html">Druid</a> can use such an object as a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/index.html#spellcasting">Spellcasting</a> focus. <br/>
<strong>Fishing Tackle.</strong> This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting. <br/>
<strong>Healer's Kit.</strong> This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> (Medicine) check. <br/>
<strong>Holy Symbol.</strong> A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/index.html#spellcasting">Spellcasting</a> focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield. <br/>
<strong>Holy Water.</strong> As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. <br/>
A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.  <br/>
<strong>Hunting Trap.</strong> When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.  <br/>
<strong>Lamp.</strong> A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. <br/>
<strong>Lantern, Bullseye.</strong> A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. <br/>
<strong>Lantern, Hooded.</strong> A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.  <br/>
<strong>Lock.</strong> A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices. <br/>
<strong>Magnifying Glass.</strong> This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a> on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed. <br/>
<strong>Manacles.</strong> These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> check. Manacles have 15 hit points. <br/>
<strong>Mess Kit.</strong> This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl. <br/>
<strong>Oil.</strong> Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/combat/cover/index.html">Cover</a> a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. <br/>
<strong>Poison, Basic.</strong> You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Poisoned</a> weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying. <br/>
<strong>Potion of Healing.</strong> A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action. <br/>
<strong>Pouch.</strong> A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section). <br/>
<strong>Quiver.</strong> A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows. <br/>
<strong>Ram, Portable.</strong> You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a> on this check. <br/>
<strong>Rations.</strong> Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts. <br/>
<strong>Rope.</strong> Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> check. <br/>
<strong>Scale, Merchant's.</strong> A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth. <br/>
<strong>Spellbook.</strong> Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells. <br/>
<strong>Spyglass.</strong> Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size. <br/>
<strong>Tent.</strong> A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two. <br/>
<strong>Tinderbox.</strong> This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch--or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel--takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute. <br/>
<strong>Torch.</strong> A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.</p>
