<p>An everdancing weapon is much like a dancing weapon, though it can be loosed with a <a href="SRD_Free_Actions.html" title="SRD:Free Actions">free action</a> and will fight as long as desired. It can move up to 60 feet away from its owner. Its owner can instruct it to move to a different target as a move-equivalent action. If its owner is rendered unconscious or otherwise unable to direct it, it will fight the same opponent as long as that opponent is conscious and within range. The owner of an everdancing weapon can grasp it again as a <a href="SRD_Free_Actions.html" title="SRD:Free Actions">free action</a> (assuming it is within reach).
