<p><em>6th-level evocation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/combat/cover/index.html">Cover</a> to creatures behind it, and its space is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/combat/movement_and_position/index.html#difficult-terrain">Difficult Terrain</a>.  <br/>
When a creature enters the wall's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. </p></div>
