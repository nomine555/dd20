<p>Just as with weapons, you can purchase or craft masterwork versions of armor or shields. Such a well-made item functions like the normal version, except that its <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Armor_Check_Penalty" title="SRD:Armor Check Penalty" class="mw-redirect">armor check penalty</a> is lessened by 1.
</p><p>A masterwork suit of armor or shield costs an extra 150 gp over and above the normal cost for that type of armor or shield.
</p><p>The masterwork quality of a suit of armor or shield never provides a bonus on attack or <a href="SRD_Attack_Damage.html" title="SRD:Attack Damage">damage rolls</a>, even if the armor or shield is used as a weapon.
</p><p>All magic armors and shields are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality.
</p><p>You canâ€™t add the masterwork quality to armor or a shield after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork item.
