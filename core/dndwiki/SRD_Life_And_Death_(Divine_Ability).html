<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Life_and_Death">Life and Death</span></h2>
<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Divine rank 6, <a href="SRD_Gift_Of_Life_(Divine_Ability).html" title="SRD:Gift Of Life (Divine Ability)">Gift of Life</a> or <a href="SRD_Hand_Of_Death_(Divine_Ability).html" title="SRD:Hand Of Death (Divine Ability)">Hand of Death</a> salient divine ability.
</p><p><b>Benefit:</b> The deity designates any mortal and snuffs out its life. Or the deity can designate any <a href="SRD_Dead.html" title="SRD:Dead">dead</a> mortal and restore it to life.
</p><p><b>Notes:</b> This ability works across planar boundaries and penetrates any barrier except a <a href="SRD_Divine_Shield_(Divine_Ability).html" title="SRD:Divine Shield (Divine Ability)">Divine Shield</a>. However, the subject must be in a location the deity can sense, either within the deityâ€™s sense range or in a location the deity can perceive through its remote sensing ability. If the deity cannot see the subject, the deity must unambiguously identify the subject in some fashion. If the deity chooses to kill a mortal, the ability works like the <i><a href="SRD_Destruction.html" title="SRD:Destruction">destruction</a> </i>spell, except that there is no material component or <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a>. The mortal cannot be raised or resurrected afterward, except by a deity of equal or higher rank using the Gift of Life or Life and Death salient divine ability.
</p><p>If the deity restores life to a mortal, this ability works like the <i><a href="SRD_True_Resurrection.html" title="SRD:True Resurrection">true resurrection</a> </i>spell, except that there is no material component and the amount of time the subject has been <a href="SRD_Dead.html" title="SRD:Dead">dead</a> is irrelevant.
</p><p>This ability cannot restore a creature to life against its will, but it can resurrect an <a href="SRD_Elemental_Type.html" title="SRD:Elemental Type">elemental</a> or <a href="SRD_Outsider_Type.html" title="SRD:Outsider Type">outsider</a>. It can resurrect a creature whose soul is trapped, provided the soul is not held by a deity of higher rank than the one using this ability.
</p><p>This ability cannot restore life to a creature that has been slain by the <a href="SRD_Hand_Of_Death_(Divine_Ability).html" title="SRD:Hand Of Death (Divine Ability)">Hand of Death</a>, Life and Death, or <a href="SRD_Mass_Life_And_Death_(Divine_Ability).html" title="SRD:Mass Life And Death (Divine Ability)">Mass Life and Death</a> ability of a deity with a higher rank.
</p><p><b>Rest: </b>After using either version of this ability, the deity must rest for 1 minute per level or <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">Hit Die</a> of the creature affected.
</p><p>Deities whose portfolio includes death do not have to rest after using this ability.
</p><p><b>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</b> Death, supreme.
