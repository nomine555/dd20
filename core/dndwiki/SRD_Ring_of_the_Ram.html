<p><b>Ram:</b> The <i>ring of the ram </i>is an ornate ring forged of hard metal, usually iron or an iron alloy. It has the head of a ram as its device.
</p><p>The wearer can command the ring to give forth a ramlike force, manifested by a vaguely discernible shape that resembles the head of a ram or a goat. This force strikes a single target, dealing 1d6 points of damage if 1 charge is expended, 2d6 points if 2 charges are used, or 3d6 points if 3 charges (the maximum) are used. Treat this as a <a href="SRD_Ranged_Attack.html" title="SRD:Ranged Attack" class="mw-redirect">ranged attack</a> with a 50-foot maximum range and no penalties for distance. 
</p><p>The force of the blow is considerable, and those struck by the ring are subject to a bull rush if within 30 feet of the ring-wearer. (The ram has <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> 25 and is Large.) The ram gains a +1 bonus on the bull rush attempt if 2 charges are expended, or +2 if 3 charges are expended.
</p><p>In addition to its attack mode, the <i>ring of the ram </i>also has the power to open doors as if it were a character with <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> 25. If 2 charges are expended, the effect is equivalent to a character with <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> 27. If 3 charges are expended, the effect is that of a character with <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> 29.
</p><p>A newly created ring has 50 charges. When all the charges are expended, the ring becomes a nonmagical item.
</p><p>Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; <a href="SRD_Forge_Ring.html" title="SRD:Forge Ring">Forge Ring</a>, <i><a href="SRD_Bull%27s_Strength.html" title="SRD:Bull's Strength">bullâ€™s strength</a>, <a href="SRD_Telekinesis.html" title="SRD:Telekinesis">telekinesis</a>; </i>Price 8,600 gp.
