<p><em>3rd-level illusion</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> S, M (a glowing stick of incense or a crystal vial filled with phosphorescent material)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute </p>
<p>You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a> for the duration. While <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a> by this spell, the creature is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Incapacitated</a> and has a speed of 0.  <br/>
The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.</p></div>
