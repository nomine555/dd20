<p>You create a finite plane with limited access: a demiplane. Demiplanes created by this power are very small, very minor planes. This power works best when manifested while you are on the <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Astral_Plane_(Planes)" title="SRD:Astral Plane (Planes)" class="mw-redirect">Astral Plane</a>. Manifestation of this power creates a local density fluctuation that precipitates the creation of a demiplane. At first, the fledgling plane grows in radius at a rate of 1 foot per day to an initial maximum radius of 180 feet as it rapidly draws substance from the surrounding astral ectoplasm. Once the new demiplane reaches its maximum size, it doesn’t really stop growing, but its growth rate decreases to only 1 foot per week (approximately a 50-foot increase in radius per year). Once your demiplane is created, you can travel to it using <i><a href="SRD_Astral_Caravan.html" title="SRD:Astral Caravan">astral caravan</a></i>, <i><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Plane_Shift_(Spell)" title="SRD:Plane Shift (Spell)" class="mw-redirect">plane shift</a></i>, or some other power or permanent link that you arrange for separately.
</p><p>You determine the environment within the demiplane when you manifest <i>genesis, </i>reflecting most any desire you can visualize. You determine factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain. This power cannot create life (including vegetation), nor can it create construction (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth). You must add these details in some other fashion if you desire. You can’t create lingering psionic effects with this power; you have to add those separately, if desired. Similarly, you can’t create a demiplane out of esoteric material, such as silver or uranium; you’re limited to stone and dirt. You can’t manipulate the time trait on your demiplane; its time trait is as the <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Material_Plane_(Planes)" title="SRD:Material Plane (Planes)" class="mw-redirect">Material Plane</a>. Once your demiplane reaches 180 feet in radius, you can manifest this power again to gradually add another 180 feet of radius to it, and so on.
</p><p>Antigenesis: If <i>genesis </i>is manifested on the <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Material_Plane_(Planes)" title="SRD:Material Plane (Planes)" class="mw-redirect">Material Plane</a>, the power takes effect and the demiplane begins to grow at the rate noted above, but it gets no larger than a radius of 1 foot per level. The energies of the new plane are exactly canceled by the energies of the original plane, creating a dead spot like a limited cancer on the original plane. The expanding boundary of the dead spot wipes away all construction, crumbles natural land forms, and evaporates water, leaving behind a uniformly level area of inert dust. Living creatures that pass the boundary of the growing dead spot are not directly affected, but plants can find no sustenance in the dust of the dead spot, water-breathing creatures die quickly when water turns to dust, and mobile animals know enough to leave the area alone. Once the wave of change passes, no special essence remains in the dead spot, and it may be colonized naturally over the course of several years by bacteria, plants, and animals.
