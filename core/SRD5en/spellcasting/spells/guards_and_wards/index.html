<p><em>6th-level abjuration</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of monster blood, and a small silver rod worth at least 10 gp)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours </p>
<p>You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.  <br/>
When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.  <br/>
<strong><em>Guards and wards</em></strong> creates the following effects within the warded area. <br/>
<strong>Corridors.</strong> Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.  <br/>
<strong>Doors.</strong> All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/arcane_lock/index.html">Arcane Lock</a></em></strong> spell. In addition, you can <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/combat/cover/index.html">Cover</a> up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/minor_illusion/index.html">Minor Illusion</a></em></strong> spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.  <br/>
<strong>Stairs.</strong> Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/web/index.html">Web</a></em></strong> spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while <strong><em>guards and wards</em></strong> lasts.  <br/>
<strong>Other Spell Effect.</strong> You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.</p>
<ul>
<li>Place <strong><em>*Dancing <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/light/index.html">Light</a>s*</em></strong> in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as <strong><em>guards and wards</em></strong> lasts.</li>
<li>Place <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/magic_mouth/index.html">Magic Mouth</a></em></strong> in two locations.</li>
<li>Place <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/stinking_cloud/index.html">Stinking Cloud</a></em></strong> in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while <strong><em>guards and wards</em></strong> lasts.</li>
<li>Place a <strong><em>constant <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/gust_of_wind/index.html">Gust of Wind</a></em></strong> in one corridor or room.</li>
<li>Place a <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/suggestion/index.html">Suggestion</a></em></strong> in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally. </li>
</ul>
<p>The whole warded area radiates magic. A <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/dispel_magic/index.html">Dispel Magic</a></em></strong> cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.  <br/>
You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year. </p></div>
