<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em> </p>
<p>Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be <strong>dust of disappearance</strong>, and an <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/identify/index.html">Identify</a></em></strong> spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.  <br/>
When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Incapacitated</a> and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/lesser_restoration/index.html">Lesser Restoration</a></em></strong> spell can also end the effect on a creature. </p></div>
