<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Arcane_Spells">Arcane Spells</span></h2>
<p><a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">Wizards</a>, <a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">sorcerers</a>, and <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bards</a> cast arcane spells. Compared to divine spells, arcane spells are more likely to produce dramatic results.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Preparing_Wizard_Spells">Preparing <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">Wizard</a> Spells</span></h3>
<p>A <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a>’s level limits the number of spells she can prepare and cast. Her high <a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Intelligence</a> score might allow her to prepare a few extra spells. She can prepare the same spell more than once, but each preparation counts as one spell toward her daily limit. To prepare a spell the <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> must have an <a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Intelligence</a> score of at least 10 + the spell’s level.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Rest">Rest</span></h5>
<p>To prepare her daily spells, a <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> must first sleep for 8 hours. The <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> does not have to slumber for every minute of the time, but she must refrain from movement, combat, spellcasting, skill use, conversation, or any other fairly demanding physical or mental task during the rest period. If her rest is interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour to the total amount of time she has to rest in order to clear her mind, and she must have at least 1 hour of uninterrupted rest immediately prior to preparing her spells. If the character does not need to sleep for some reason, she still must have 8 hours of restful calm before preparing any spells. 
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Recent_Casting_Limit.2FRest_Interruptions">Recent Casting Limit/Rest Interruptions</span></h5>
<p>If a <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> has cast spells recently, the drain on her resources reduces her capacity to prepare new spells. When she prepares spells for the coming day, all the spells she has cast within the last 8 hours count against her daily limit.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Preparation_Environment">Preparation Environment</span></h5>
<p>To prepare any spell, a <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> must have enough peace, quiet, and comfort to allow for proper concentration. The <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a>’s surroundings need not be luxurious, but they must be free from overt distractions. Exposure to inclement weather prevents the necessary concentration, as does any injury or failed <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> the character might experience while studying. <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">Wizards</a> also must have access to their spellbooks to study from and sufficient light to read them by. There is one major exception: A <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> can prepare a <i>read magic </i>spell even without a spellbook. 
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Spell_Preparation_Time">Spell Preparation Time</span></h5>
<p>After resting, a <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> must study her spellbook to prepare any spells that day. If she wants to prepare all her spells, the process takes 1 hour. Preparing some smaller portion of her daily capacity takes a proportionally smaller amount of time, but always at least 15 minutes, the minimum time required to achieve the proper mental state.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Spell_Selection_and_Preparation">Spell Selection and Preparation</span></h5>
<p>Until she prepares spells from her spellbook, the only spells a <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> has available to cast are the ones that she already had prepared from the previous day and has not yet used. During the study period, she chooses which spells to prepare. If a <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> already has spells prepared (from the previous day) that she has not cast, she can abandon some or all of them to make room for new spells.
</p><p>When preparing spells for the day, a <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> can leave some of these spell slots open. Later during that day, she can repeat the preparation process as often as she likes, time and circumstances permitting. During these extra sessions of preparation, the <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> can fill these unused spell slots. She cannot, however, abandon a previously prepared spell to replace it with another one or fill a slot that is empty because she has cast a spell in the meantime. That sort of preparation requires a mind fresh from rest. Like the first session of the day, this preparation takes at least 15 minutes, and it takes longer if the <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> prepares more than one-quarter of her spells.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Spell_Slots">Spell Slots</span></h5>
<p>The various <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">character class</a> tables show how many spells of each level a character can cast per day. These openings for daily spells are called spell slots. A spellcaster always has the option to fill a higher-level spell slot with a lower-level spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough <a href="SRD_Ability_Scores.html" title="SRD:Ability Scores">ability score</a> to cast spells that would otherwise be his or her due still gets the slots but must fill them with spells of lower level.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Prepared_Spell_Retention">Prepared Spell Retention</span></h5>
<p>Once a <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> prepares a spell, it remains in her mind as a nearly cast spell until she uses the prescribed components to complete and trigger it or until she abandons it. Certain other events, such as the effects of magic items or special attacks from monsters, can wipe a prepared spell from a character’s mind.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Death_and_Prepared_Spell_Retention">Death and Prepared Spell Retention</span></h5>
<p>If a spellcaster dies, all prepared spells stored in his or her mind are wiped away. Potent magic (such as <i>raise <a href="SRD_Dead.html" title="SRD:Dead">dead</a>, resurrection, </i>or <i>true resurrection</i>) can recover the lost energy when it recovers the character.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Arcane_Magical_Writings">Arcane Magical Writings</span></h3>
<p>To record an arcane spell in written form, a character uses complex notation that describes the magical forces involved in the spell. The writer uses the same system no matter what her native language or culture. However, each character uses the system in her own way. Another person’s magical writing remains incomprehensible to even the most powerful <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> until she takes time to study and decipher it.
</p><p>To decipher an arcane magical writing (such as a single spell in written form in another’s spellbook or on a scroll), a character must make a <a href="SRD_Spellcraft_Skill.html" title="SRD:Spellcraft Skill">Spellcraft</a> check (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 20 + the spell’s level). If the <a href="SRD_Skill_Check.html" title="SRD:Skill Check" class="mw-redirect">skill check</a> fails, the character cannot attempt to read that particular spell again until the next day. A <i>read magic </i>spell automatically deciphers a magical writing without a <a href="SRD_Skill_Check.html" title="SRD:Skill Check" class="mw-redirect">skill check</a>. If the person who created the magical writing is on hand to help the reader, success is also automatic.
</p><p>Once a character deciphers a particular magical writing, she does not need to decipher it again. Deciphering a magical writing allows the reader to identify the spell and gives some idea of its effects (as explained in the spell description). If the magical writing was a scroll and the reader can cast arcane spells, she can attempt to use the scroll.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Wizard_Spells_and_Borrowed_Spellbooks">Wizard Spells and Borrowed Spellbooks</span></h4>
<p>A <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> can use a borrowed spellbook to prepare a spell she already knows and has recorded in her own spellbook, but preparation success is not assured. First, the <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> must decipher the writing in the book (see Arcane Magical Writings, above). Once a spell from another spellcaster’s book is deciphered, the reader must make a <a href="SRD_Spellcraft_Skill.html" title="SRD:Spellcraft Skill">Spellcraft</a> check (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 + spell’s level) to prepare the spell. If the check succeeds, the <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> can prepare the spell. She must repeat the check to prepare the spell again, no matter how many times she has prepared it before. If the check fails, she cannot try to prepare the spell from the same source again until the next day. (However, as explained above, she does not need to repeat a check to decipher the writing.)
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Adding_Spells_to_a_Wizard.E2.80.99s_Spellbook">Adding Spells to a <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">Wizard</a>’s Spellbook</span></h4>
<p><a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">Wizards</a> can add new spells to their spellbooks through several methods. If a <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> has chosen to specialize in a school of magic, she can learn spells only from schools whose spells she can cast.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Spells_Gained_at_a_New_Level">Spells Gained at a New Level</span></h5>
<p><a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">Wizards</a> perform a certain amount of spell research between adventures. Each time a character attains a new <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> level, she gains two spells of her choice to add to her spellbook. The two free spells must be of <a href="SRD_Spell_Level.html" title="SRD:Spell Level" class="mw-redirect">spell levels</a> she can cast. If she has chosen to specialize in a school of magic, one of the two free spells must be from her specialty school.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Spells_Copied_from_Another.E2.80.99s_Spellbook_or_a_Scroll">Spells Copied from Another’s Spellbook or a Scroll</span></h5>
<p>A <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> can also add a spell to her book whenever she encounters one on a magic scroll or in another <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a>’s spellbook. No matter what the spell’s source, the <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> must first decipher the magical writing (see Arcane Magical Writings, above). Next, she must spend a day studying the spell. At the end of the day, she must make a <a href="SRD_Spellcraft_Skill.html" title="SRD:Spellcraft Skill">Spellcraft</a> check (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 + spell’s level). A <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> who has specialized in a school of spells gains a +2 bonus on the <a href="SRD_Spellcraft_Skill.html" title="SRD:Spellcraft Skill">Spellcraft</a> check if the new spell is from her specialty school. She cannot, however, learn any spells from her prohibited schools. If the check succeeds, the <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> understands the spell and can copy it into her spellbook (see Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook, below). The process leaves a spellbook that was copied from unharmed, but a spell successfully copied from a magic scroll disappears from the parchment.
</p><p>If the check fails, the <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> cannot understand or copy the spell. She cannot attempt to learn or copy that spell again until she gains another rank in <a href="SRD_Spellcraft_Skill.html" title="SRD:Spellcraft Skill">Spellcraft</a>. A spell that was being copied from a scroll does not vanish from the scroll.
</p><p>In most cases, <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizards</a> charge a fee for the privilege of copying spells from their spellbooks. This fee is usually equal to the spell’s level x50 gp.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Independent_Research">Independent Research</span></h5>
<p>A <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> also can research a spell independently, duplicating an existing spell or creating an entirely new one.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Writing_a_New_Spell_into_a_Spellbook">Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook</span></h5>
<p>Once a <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> understands a new spell, she can record it into her spellbook.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Time">Time</span></h5>
<p>The process takes 24 hours, regardless of the spell’s level.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Space_in_the_Spellbook">Space in the Spellbook</span></h5>
<p>A spell takes up one page of the spellbook per <a href="SRD_Spell_Level.html" title="SRD:Spell Level" class="mw-redirect">spell level</a>. Even a 0-level spell (cantrip) takes one page. A spellbook has one hundred pages.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Materials_and_Costs">Materials and Costs</span></h5>
<p>Materials for writing the spell cost 100 gp per page.
</p><p>Note that a <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> does not have to pay these costs in time or gold for the spells she gains for free at each new level. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Replacing_and_Copying_Spellbooks">Replacing and Copying Spellbooks</span></h4>
<p>A <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> can use the procedure for learning a spell to reconstruct a lost spellbook. If she already has a particular spell prepared, she can write it directly into a new book at a cost of 100 gp per page (as noted in Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook, above). The process wipes the prepared spell from her mind, just as casting it would. If she does not have the spell prepared, she can prepare it from a borrowed spellbook and then write it into a new book.
</p><p>Duplicating an existing spellbook uses the same procedure as replacing it, but the task is much easier. The time requirement and cost per page are halved.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Selling_a_Spellbook">Selling a Spellbook</span></h4>
<p>Captured spellbooks can be sold for a gp amount equal to one-half the cost of purchasing and inscribing the spells within (that is, one-half of 100 gp per page of spells). A spellbook entirely filled with spells (that is, with one hundred pages of spells inscribed in it) is worth 5,000 gp.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sorcerers_and_Bards">Sorcerers and <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">Bards</a></span></h3>
<p><a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">Sorcerers</a> and <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bards</a> cast arcane spells, but they do not have spellbooks and do not prepare their spells. A <a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">sorcerer</a>’s or <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a>’s <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> level limits the number of spells he can cast (see these <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> descriptions). His high <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a> score might allow him to cast a few extra spells. A member of either <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> must have a <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a> score of at least 10 + a spell’s level to cast the spell.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Daily_Readying_of_Spells">Daily Readying of Spells</span></h5>
<p>Each day, <a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">sorcerers</a> and <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bards</a> must focus their minds on the task of casting their spells. A <a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">sorcerer</a> or <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a> needs 8 hours of rest (just like a <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a>), after which he spends 15 minutes concentrating. (A <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a> must sing, recite, or play an instrument of some kind while concentrating.) During this period, the <a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">sorcerer</a> or <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a> readies his mind to cast his daily allotment of spells. Without such a period to refresh himself, the character does not regain the spell slots he used up the day before.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Recent_Casting_Limit">Recent Casting Limit</span></h5>
<p>As with <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizards</a>, any spells cast within the last 8 hours count against the <a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">sorcerer</a>’s or <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a>’s daily limit.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Adding_Spells_to_a_Sorcerer.E2.80.99s_or_Bard.E2.80.99s_Repertoire">Adding Spells to a <a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">Sorcerer</a>’s or <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">Bard</a>’s Repertoire</span></h5>
<p>A <a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">sorcerer</a> or <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a> gains spells each time he attains a new level in his <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> and never gains spells any other way. When your <a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">sorcerer</a> or <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a> gains a new level, consult Table: <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">Bard</a> Spells Known or Table: <a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">Sorcerer</a> Spells Known to learn how many spells from the appropriate spell list he now knows. With permission, <a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">sorcerers</a> and <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bards</a> can also select the spells they gain from new and unusual spells that they have gained some understanding of.
