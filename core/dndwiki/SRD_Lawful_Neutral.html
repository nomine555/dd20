<p>A lawful neutral character acts as law, tradition, or a personal code directs her. Order and organization are paramount to her. She may believe in personal order and live by a code or standard, or she may believe in order for all and favor a strong, organized government.
</p><p>Lawful neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you are reliable and honorable without being a zealot.
