<p>You can create any <a href="SRD_Psicrowns.html" title="SRD:Psicrowns">psicrown</a> whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a psicrown takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a psicrown, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of its base price. Some psicrowns incur extra costs in XP as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the psicrownâ€™s base price.
