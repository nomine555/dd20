<p><em>2nd-level evocation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a chip of mica)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p>A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> on this saving throw.  <br/>
A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area. </p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd. </p></div>
