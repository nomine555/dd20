<p><b>Power Storing:</b> A power storing weapon allows a manifester to store a single targeted power of up to 5 <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> in the weapon. (The power must have a manifesting time of 1 <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>.) Any time the weapon strikes a creature and the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately manifest the power on that creature as a <a href="SRD_Swift_Actions.html" title="SRD:Swift Actions">swift action</a> if the wielder desires. (This ability is an exception to the rule that manifesting a power from an item takes at least as long as manifesting that power normally.) Once the power is manifested, the weapon is empty, and a manifester can imbed any other targeted power of up to 5 <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> into it. The weapon telepathically whispers to the wearer the name of the power currently stored within it. A randomly generated power storing weapon has a 50% chance to have a power stored in it already.
