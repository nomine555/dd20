<p><b>Shooting Stars:</b> This ring has two modes of operation, one for being in shadowy darkness or outdoors at night and a second one when the wearer is underground or indoors at night.
</p><p>During the night under the open sky or in areas of shadow or darkness, the <i>ring of shooting stars </i>can perform the following functions on command.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <i><a href="SRD_Dancing_Lights.html" title="SRD:Dancing Lights">Dancing lights</a> </i>(once per hour)
</li>
<li> <i><a href="SRD_Light.html" title="SRD:Light">Light</a> </i>(twice per night)
</li>
<li> <i>Ball lightning </i>(special, once per night)
</li>
<li> <i>Shooting stars </i>(special, three per week)
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first special function, <i>ball lightning, </i>releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearerâ€™s choice). These glowing globes resemble <i>dancing lights</i>, and the ring wearer controls them in the same fashion (see the <i><a href="SRD_Dancing_Lights.html" title="SRD:Dancing Lights">dancing lights</a> </i>spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created.
</p>

<p>Once the <i>ball lightning </i>function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. (Multiple balls can be released in the same <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>.)
</p><p>The second special function produces three <i>shooting stars </i>that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. They impact for 12 points of damage and spread (as a <i><a href="SRD_Fireball.html" title="SRD:Fireball">fireball</a></i>) in a 5-foot-radius sphere for 24 points of fire damage.
</p><p>Any creature struck by a <i>shooting star </i>takes full damage from impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it makes a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 13 <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 13 <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> save. Range is 70 feet, at the end of which the <i>shooting star </i>explodes, unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A <i>shooting star </i>always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a save or be hit by the projectile.
</p><p>Indoors at night, or underground, the <i>ring of shooting stars </i>has the following properties.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <i><a href="SRD_Faerie_Fire.html" title="SRD:Faerie Fire">Faerie fire</a> </i>(twice per day)
</li>
<li> <i>Spark shower </i>(special, once per day)
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <i>spark shower </i>is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arc 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal armor or carrying a metal weapon. Those wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon take 4d8 points of damage.
