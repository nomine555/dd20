<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Astral_Plane">The Astral Plane</span></h3>
<p>The Astral Plane is the space between the planes. When a character moves through an interplanar portal or projects her spirit to a different plane of existence, she travels through the Astral Plane. Even spells that allow instantaneous movement across a plane<i> </i>briefly touch the Astral Plane.
</p><p>The Astral Plane is a great, endless sphere of clear silvery sky, both above and below. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.
</p><p>Both planar travelers and refugees from other planes call the Astral Plane home. 
</p><p>The Astral Plane has the following traits.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Subjective directional gravity.
</li>
<li>Timeless. Age, hunger, thirst, poison, and natural healing donâ€™t function in the Astral Plane, though they resume functioning when the traveler leaves the Astral Plane.
</li>
<li>Mildly neutral-aligned.
</li>
<li>Enhanced magic. All spells and <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like abilities</a> used within the Astral Plane may be employed as if they were improved by the <a href="SRD_Quicken_Spell.html" title="SRD:Quicken Spell">Quicken Spell</a> <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>. Already quickened spells and <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like abilities</a> are unaffected, as are spells from magic items. Spells so quickened are still prepared and cast at their unmodified level. As with the Quicken Spell <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>, only one quickened spell can be cast per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>.

</ul>
