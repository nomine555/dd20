<p>If a creature with this <a href="SRD_Reading_Creature_Entries.html" title="SRD:Reading Creature Entries">special attack</a> hits with a <a href="SRD_Melee_Weapon.html" title="SRD:Melee Weapon">melee weapon</a> (usually a claw or bite attack), it deals normal damage and attempts to start a <a href="SRD_Grapple.html" title="SRD:Grapple">grapple</a> as a <a href="SRD_Free_Actions.html" title="SRD:Free Actions">free action</a> without provoking an <a href="SRD_Attacks_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attacks of Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>. No initial <a href="SRD_Touch_Attack.html" title="SRD:Touch Attack" class="mw-redirect">touch attack</a> is required. 
</p><p>Unless otherwise noted, improved grab works only against opponents at least one <a href="SRD_Size_Category.html" title="SRD:Size Category" class="mw-redirect">size category</a> smaller than the creature. The creature has the option to conduct the <a href="SRD_Grapple.html" title="SRD:Grapple">grapple</a> normally, or simply use the part of its body it used in the improved grab to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the latter, it takes a –20 penalty on <a href="SRD_Grapple.html" title="SRD:Grapple">grapple</a> checks, but is not considered <a href="SRD_Grappling.html" title="SRD:Grappling">grappled</a> itself; the creature does not lose its <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dexterity</a> bonus to <a href="SRD_Armor_Class.html" title="SRD:Armor Class">AC</a>, still threatens an area, and can use its remaining attacks against other opponents. A successful hold does not deal any extra damage unless the creature also has the <a href="SRD_Constrict.html" title="SRD:Constrict">constrict</a> special attack. If the creature does not constrict, each successful <a href="SRD_Grapple.html" title="SRD:Grapple">grapple</a> check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the damage indicated for the attack that established the hold. Otherwise, it deals constriction damage as well (the amount is given in the creature’s descriptive text). When a creature gets a hold after an improved grab attack, it pulls the opponent into its space. This act does not provoke <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a>. It can even move (possibly carrying away the opponent), provided it can drag the opponent’s weight.
