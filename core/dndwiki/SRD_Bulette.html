<p>Also known as the landshark, the bulette is a terrifying predator that lives only to eat.  
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="COMBAT">COMBAT</span></h3>
<p>A bulette attacks anything it regards as edible, choosing the easiest or closest prey first. The only creatures it refuses to eat are <a href="SRD_Elf_Subtype.html" title="SRD:Elf Subtype">elves</a> (and it dislikes the taste of <a href="SRD_Dwarf_Subtype.html" title="SRD:Dwarf Subtype">dwarves</a>). When burrowing underground, a landshark relies on its <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Tremorsense&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Tremorsense (page does not exist)">tremorsense</a> ability to detect prey.
</p><p>When it senses something edible (that is, senses movement), it breaks to the surface, crest first, and begins its attack.
</p><p><b>Leap (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ex" title="SRD:Ex" class="mw-redirect">Ex</a>):</b> A bulette can <a href="SRD_Jump.html" title="SRD:Jump">jump</a> into the air during combat. This allows it to make four claw attacks instead of two, each with a +15 attack bonus, but it cannot bite.
