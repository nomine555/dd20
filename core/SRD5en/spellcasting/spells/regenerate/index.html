<p><em>7th-level transmutation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a prayer wheel and holy water)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour </p>
<p>You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).  <br/>
The target's severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump. </p></div>
