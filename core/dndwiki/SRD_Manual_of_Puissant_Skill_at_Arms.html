<p><b>Manual of Puissant Skill at Arms: </b>This treatise contains expert advice and instruction in the arts of combat. Any <a href="SRD_Barbarian.html" title="SRD:Barbarian">barbarian</a>, <a href="SRD_Fighter.html" title="SRD:Fighter">fighter</a>, <a href="SRD_Monk.html" title="SRD:Monk">monk</a>, <a href="SRD_Paladin.html" title="SRD:Paladin">paladin</a>, or <a href="SRD_Ranger.html" title="SRD:Ranger">ranger</a> who spends one week studying the manual gains a +1 inherent bonus to <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> and experience points sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the reader has levels in more than one of the <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">classes</a> listed, he or she must choose one of the <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">classes</a> to be affected.) A character without any levels in one of the <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">classes</a> listed gains no bonus from the work, but if an arcane spellcaster without levels in one of the <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">classes</a> listed scans even a single word he or she will lose 2dx1,000 XP and must make a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Will</a> save (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 20) or have 1 point of <a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Intelligence</a> permanently drained. Except as indicated above, the writing in a <i>manual of puissant skill at arms </i>canâ€™t be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character ever benefit from reading a similar tome a second time.
