<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="feats">Feats</h1>
<p>A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.  <br/>
At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.  <br/>
You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> of 13 or higher. If your <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> is reduced below 13 somehow--perhaps by a withering curse--you can't benefit from the Grappler feat until your <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> is restored.</p>
<h2 id="grappler">Grappler</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> 13 or higher  <br/>
You've developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a> on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.</li>
<li>You can use your action to try to pin a creature <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Grappled</a> by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a> until the grapple ends.</li>
