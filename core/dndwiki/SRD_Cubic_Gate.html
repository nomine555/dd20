<p><b>Cubic Gate: </b>This item is fashioned from carnelian. Each of the six sides of the cube is keyed to a plane, one of which is the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>. The character creating the item should choose the planes to which the other five sides are keyed.
</p><p>If a side of the <i>cubic gate </i>is pressed once, it opens a <i><a href="SRD_Gate.html" title="SRD:Gate">gate</a> </i>to a random point on the plane keyed to that side. There is a 10% chance per minute that an <a href="SRD_Outsider_Type.html" title="SRD:Outsider Type">outsider</a> from that plane (determine randomly) comes through it looking for food, fun, or trouble. Pressing the side a second time closes the <i>gate</i>. It is impossible to open more than one <i>gate </i>at a time.
</p><p>If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so doing is transported to a random point on the other plane, along with all creatures in adjacent squares. (The other creatures may avoid this fate by succeeding on <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 23 <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Will</a> saves).
