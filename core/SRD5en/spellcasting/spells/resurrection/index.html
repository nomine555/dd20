<p><em>7th-level necromancy</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p>You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn't die of old age, and that isn't undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.  <br/>
This spell neutralizes any <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/poisons/index.html">Poisons</a> and cures normal <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/diseases/index.html">Diseases</a> afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn't, however, remove magical <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/diseases/index.html">Diseases</a>, curses, and the like; if such effects aren't removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.  <br/>
This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.  <br/>
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a âˆ’4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.  <br/>
Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can't cast spells again, and you have <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. </p></div>
