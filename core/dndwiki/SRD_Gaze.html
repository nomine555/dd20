<p>A gaze special attack takes effect when opponents look at the creature’s eyes. The attack can have almost any sort of effect: petrification, death, charm, and so on. The typical range is 30 feet, but check the creature’s entry for details. The type of <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> for a gaze attack varies, but it is usually a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Will</a> or <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 10 + 1/2 gazing creature’s racial <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">HD</a> + gazing creature’s <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Cha</a> modifier; the exact <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> is given in the creature’s descriptive text). A successful <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> negates the effect. A monster’s gaze attack is described in abbreviated form in its description. Each opponent within range of a gaze attack must attempt a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> at the beginning of his or her turn in the initiative order. Only looking directly at a creature with a gaze attack leaves an opponent vulnerable. Opponents can avoid the need to make the <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> by not looking at the creature, in one of two ways. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Averting_Eyes">Averting Eyes</span></h4>
<p>The opponent avoids looking at the creature’s face, instead looking at its body, watching its shadow, tracking it in a reflective surface, and so on. Each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, the opponent has a 50% chance to not need to make a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> against the gaze attack. The creature with the gaze attack, however, gains <a href="SRD_Concealment.html" title="SRD:Concealment">concealment</a> against that opponent.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Wearing_a_Blindfold">Wearing a Blindfold</span></h4>
<p>The opponent cannot see the creature at all (also possible to achieve by turning one’s back on the creature or shutting one’s eyes). The creature with the gaze attack gains total <a href="SRD_Concealment.html" title="SRD:Concealment">concealment</a> against the opponent. 
</p><p>A creature with a gaze attack can actively gaze as an attack action by choosing a target within range. That opponent must attempt a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> but can try to avoid this as described above. Thus, it is possible for an opponent to save against a creature’s gaze twice during the same <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, once before the opponent’s action and once during the creature’s turn. 
</p><p>Gaze attacks can affect ethereal opponents. A creature is immune to gaze attacks of others of its kind unless otherwise noted.
</p><p>Allies of a creature with a gaze attack might be affected. All the creature’s allies are considered to be averting their eyes from the creature with the gaze attack, and have a 50% chance to not need to make a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> against the gaze attack each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. The creature also can veil its eyes, thus negating its gaze ability.
</p><p>Looking at the creature’s image (such as in a mirror or as part of an illusion) does not subject the viewer to a gaze attack.
</p><p>If visibility is limited (by dim lighting, a fog, or the like) so that it results in <a href="SRD_Concealment.html" title="SRD:Concealment">concealment</a>, there is a percentage chance equal to the normal miss chance for that degree of <a href="SRD_Concealment.html" title="SRD:Concealment">concealment</a> that a character won’t need to make a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> in a given <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. This chance is not cumulative with the chance for averting your eyes, but is rolled separately.
</p><p><a href="SRD_Invisible.html" title="SRD:Invisible">Invisible</a> creatures cannot use gaze attacks.
</p><p>Characters using darkvision in complete darkness are affected by a gaze attack normally.
</p><p>Unless specified otherwise, a creature with a gaze attack can control its gaze attack and "turn it off" when so desired.
