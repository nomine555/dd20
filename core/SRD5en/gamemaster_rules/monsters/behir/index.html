<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to constrict.  <br/>
<strong>Bite.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage.  <br/>
<strong>Constrict.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature. <em>Hit:</em> 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage. The target is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Grappled</a> (escape DC 16) if the behir isn't already constricting a creature, and the target is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a> until this grapple ends.  <br/>
<strong>Lightning Breath (Recharge 5â€“6).</strong> The behir exhales a line of lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  <br/>
<strong>Swallow.</strong> The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Blinded</a> and <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a>, it has total <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/combat/cover/index.html">Cover</a> against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.  <br/>
If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Prone</a> in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a> by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Prone</a>.</p></div>
