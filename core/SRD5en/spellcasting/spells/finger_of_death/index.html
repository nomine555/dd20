<p><em>7th-level necromancy</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p>You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw. It takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  <br/>
A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/zombie/index.html">Zombie</a> that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability. </p></div>
