<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_Magic_Items">Creating Magic Items</span></h2>
<p>To create magic items, spellcasters use special <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a>. They invest time, money, and their own personal energy (in the form of experience points) in an item’s creation.
</p><p>Note that all items have prerequisites in their descriptions. These prerequisites must be met for the item to be created. Most of the time, they take the form of spells that must be known by the item’s creator (although access through another magic item or spellcaster is allowed).
</p><p>While item creation costs are handled in detail below, note that normally the two primary factors are the <a href="SRD_Caster_Level.html" title="SRD:Caster Level" class="mw-redirect">caster level</a> of the creator and the level of the spell or spells put into the item. A creator can create an item at a lower <a href="SRD_Caster_Level.html" title="SRD:Caster Level" class="mw-redirect">caster level</a> than her own, but never lower than the minimum level needed to cast the needed spell. Using metamagic <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a>, a caster can place spells in items at a higher level than normal.
</p><p>Magic supplies for items are always half of the base price in gp and 1/25 of the base price in XP. For many items, the market price equals the base price.
</p><p>Armor, shields, weapons, and items with a value independent of their magically enhanced properties add their item cost to the market price. The item cost does not influence the base price (which determines the cost of magic supplies and the experience point cost), but it does increase the final market price.
</p><p>In addition, some items cast or replicate spells with costly material components or with XP components. For these items, the market price equals the base price plus an extra price for the spell component costs. Each XP in the component costs adds 5 gp to the market price. The cost to create these items is the magic supplies cost and the base XP cost (both determined by the base price) plus the costs for the components. Descriptions of these items include an entry that gives the total cost of creating the item.
</p><p>The creator also needs a fairly quiet, comfortable, and well-lit place in which to work. Any place suitable for preparing spells is suitable for making items. Creating an item requires one day per 1,000 gp in the item’s base price, with a minimum of at least one day. Potions are an exception to this rule; they always take just one day to brew. The character must spend the gold and XP at the beginning of the construction process.
</p><p>The caster works for 8 hours each day. He cannot rush the process by working longer each day. But the days need not be consecutive, and the caster can use the rest of his time as he sees fit.
</p><p>A character can work on only one item at a time. If a character starts work on a new item, all materials used and XP spent on the under-construction item are wasted.
</p><p>The secrets of creating artifacts are long lost.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Magic_Item_Gold_Piece_Values">Magic Item Gold Piece Values</span></h3>
<p>Many factors must be considered when determining the price of new magic items. The easiest way to come up with a price is to match the new item to an item that is already priced that price as a guide. Otherwise, use the guidelines summarized on <a href="#Table:_Estimating_Magic_Item_Gold_Piece_Values">Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values</a>.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Multiple_Similar_Abilities">Multiple Similar Abilities</span></h5>
<p>For items with multiple similar abilities that don’t take up space on a character’s body use the following formula: Calculate the price of the single most costly ability, then add 75% of the value of the next most costly ability, plus one-half the value of any other abilities.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Multiple_Different_Abilities">Multiple Different Abilities</span></h5>
<p>Abilities such as an <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack roll</a> bonus or <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> bonus and a spell-like function are not similar, and their values are simply added together to determine the cost. For items that do take up a space on a character’s body each additional power not only has no discount but instead has a 50% increase in price.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="0-Level_Spells">0-Level Spells</span></h5>
<p>When multiplying <a href="SRD_Spell_Level.html" title="SRD:Spell Level" class="mw-redirect">spell levels</a> to determine value, 0- level spells should be treated as 1/2 level.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_Considerations">Other Considerations</span></h5>
<p>Once you have a final cost figure, reduce that number if either of the following conditions applies:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Item Requires Skill to Use: </i>Some items require a specific skill to get them to function. This factor should reduce the cost about 10%.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Item Requires Specific <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">Class</a> or Alignment to Use: </i>Even more restrictive than requiring a skill, this limitation cuts the cost by 30%.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Prices presented in the magic item descriptions (the gold piece value following the item’s <a href="SRD_Caster_Level.html" title="SRD:Caster Level" class="mw-redirect">caster level</a>) are the market value, which is generally twice what it costs the creator to make the item.
</p><p>Since different <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">classes</a> get access to certain spells at different levels, the prices for two characters to make the same item might actually be different. An item is only worth two times what the caster of lowest possible level can make it for. Calculate the market price based on the lowest possible level caster, no matter who makes the item.
</p><p>Not all items adhere to these formulas directly. The reasons for this are several. First and foremost, these few formulas aren’t enough to truly gauge the exact differences between items. The price of a magic item may be modified based on its actual worth. The formulas only provide a starting point. The pricing of scrolls assumes that, whenever possible, a <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> or <a href="SRD_Cleric.html" title="SRD:Cleric">cleric</a> created it. Potions and wands follow the formulas exactly. Staffs follow the formulas closely, and other items require at least some judgment calls.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Masterwork_Items">Masterwork Items</span></h3>
<p>Masterwork items are extraordinarily well-made items. They are more expensive, but they benefit the user with improved quality. They are not magical in any way.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_Magic_Armor">Creating Magic Armor</span></h3>
<p>To create magic armor, a character needs a heat source and some iron, wood, or leatherworking tools. He also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the armor or the pieces of the armor to be assembled. Armor to be made into magic armor must be <a href="SRD_Masterwork_Armor.html" title="SRD:Masterwork Armor">masterwork armor</a>, and the masterwork cost is added to the base price to determine final market value. Additional magic supplies costs for the materials are subsumed in the cost for creating the magic armor—half the base price of the item.
</p><p>Creating magic armor has a special prerequisite: The creator’s <a href="SRD_Caster_Level.html" title="SRD:Caster Level" class="mw-redirect">caster level</a> must be at least three times the enhancement bonus of the armor. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two <a href="SRD_Caster_Level.html" title="SRD:Caster Level" class="mw-redirect">caster level</a> requirements must be met.
</p><p>Magic armor or a magic shield must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus to have any of the abilities listed on <a href="SRD_Armor.html#Table:_Armor_Special_Abilities" title="SRD:Armor">Table: Armor Special Abilities</a> and <a href="SRD_Armor.html#Table:_Shield_Special_Abilities" title="SRD:Armor">Table: Shield Special Abilities</a>.
</p><p>If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the armor, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must know the spells, in the case of a <a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">sorcerer</a> or <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a>), must provide any material components or focuses the spells require, and must pay any XP costs required for the spells.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_Magic_Weapons">Creating Magic Weapons</span></h3>
<p>To create a magic weapon, a character needs a heat source and some iron, wood, or leatherworking tools. She also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the weapon or the pieces of the weapon to be assembled. Only a <a href="SRD_Masterwork_Weapons.html" title="SRD:Masterwork Weapons">masterwork weapon</a> can become a magic weapon, and the masterwork cost is added to the total cost to determine final market value.

</p><p>Creating a magic weapon has a special prerequisite: The creator’s <a href="SRD_Caster_Level.html" title="SRD:Caster Level" class="mw-redirect">caster level</a> must be at least three times the enhancement bonus of the weapon. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability the higher of the two <a href="SRD_Caster_Level.html" title="SRD:Caster Level" class="mw-redirect">caster level</a> requirements must be met.
</p><p>A magic weapon must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus to have any of the abilities listed on <a href="SRD_Weapons.html#Table:_Melee_Weapon_Special_Abilities" title="SRD:Weapons">Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities</a> or <a href="SRD_Weapons.html#Table_Ranged_Weapon_Special_Abilities" title="SRD:Weapons">Table Ranged Weapon Special Abilities</a>.
</p><p>If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the weapon, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must know the spells, in the case of a <a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">sorcerer</a> or <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a>) but need not provide any material components or focuses the spells require, nor are any XP costs inherent in a prerequisite spell incurred in the creation of the item. The act of working on the weapon triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the weapon’s creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)
</p><p>At the time of creation, the creator must decide if the weapon glows or not as a side-effect of the magic imbued within it. This decision does not affect the price or the creation time, but once the item is finished, the decision is binding.
</p><p>Creating magic double-headed weapons is treated as creating two weapons when determining cost, time, XP, and special abilities.
</p><p>Creating some weapons may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_Potions">Creating Potions</span></h3>
<p>The creator of a potion needs a level working surface and at least a few containers in which to mix liquids, as well as a source of heat to boil the brew. In addition, he needs ingredients. The costs for materials and ingredients are subsumed in the cost for brewing the potion—25 gp &#215; the level of the spell &#215; the level of the caster.
</p><p>All ingredients and materials used to brew a potion must be fresh and unused. The character must pay the full cost for brewing each potion. (Economies of scale do not apply.)
</p><p>The imbiber of the potion is both the caster and the target. Spells with a range of personal cannot be made into potions.
</p><p>The creator must have prepared the spell to be placed in the potion (or must know the spell, in the case of a <a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">sorcerer</a> or <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a>) and must provide any material component or focus the spell requires.
</p><p>If casting the spell would reduce the caster’s XP total, he pays the XP cost upon beginning the brew in addition to the XP cost for making the potion itself. Material components are consumed when he begins working, but a focus is not. (A focus used in brewing a potion can be reused.) The act of brewing triggers the prepared spell, making it unavailable for casting until the character has rested and regained spells. (That is, that spell slot is expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if it had been cast.) Brewing a potion requires one day.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_Wondrous_Items">Creating Wondrous Items</span></h3>
<p>To create a wondrous item, a character usually needs some sort of equipment or tools to work on the item. She also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the item itself or the pieces of the item to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the item. Wondrous item costs are difficult to formularize. Refer to <a href="#Table:_Estimating_Magic_Item_Gold_Piece_Values">Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values</a> and use the item prices in the item descriptions as a guideline. Creating an item costs half the market value listed.
</p><p>If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the item, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must know the spells, in the case of a <a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">sorcerer</a> or <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a>) but need not provide any material components or focuses the spells require, nor are any XP costs inherent in a prerequisite spell incurred in the creation of the item. The act of working on the item triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the item’s creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)
</p><p>Creating some items may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.
</p><p>Crafting a wondrous item requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Intelligent_Item_Creation">Intelligent Item Creation</span></h3>
<p>To create an intelligent item, a character must have a <a href="SRD_Caster_Level.html" title="SRD:Caster Level" class="mw-redirect">caster level</a> of 15th or higher. Time and creation cost are based on the normal item creation rules, with the market price values on <a href="SRD_Intelligent_Items.html#Language_Spoken_by_Item" title="SRD:Intelligent Items">Table: Item Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and Capabilities</a> treated as additions to time, gp cost, and XP cost. The item’s alignment is the same as its creator’s. Determine other features randomly, following the guidelines in the relevant section.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Adding_New_Abilities">Adding New Abilities</span></h3>
<p>A creator can add new magical abilities to a magic item with no restrictions. The cost to do this is the same as if the item was not magical. Thus, a <i>+1 longsword </i>can be made into a <i>+2 vorpal longsword</i>, with the cost to create it being equal to that of a <i>+2 vorpal sword </i>minus the cost of a <i>+1 sword</i>.
</p><p>If the item is one that occupies a specific place on a character’s body the cost of adding any additional ability to that item increases by 50%. For example, if a character adds the power to confer <i>invisibility </i>to her <i>ring of protection +2</i>, the cost of adding this ability is the same as for creating a <i>ring of invisibility </i>multiplied by 1.5.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Body_Slot_Affinities">Body Slot Affinities</span></h3>
<p>Each location on the body, or body slot, has one or more affinities: a word or phrase that describes the general function or nature of magic items designed for that body slot. Body slot affinities are deliberately broad, abstract categorizations, because a hard-and-fast rule can’t <a href="SRD_Cover.html" title="SRD:Cover">cover</a> the great variety among wondrous items.
</p><p>You can use the affinities in the list below to guide your decisions on which magic items should be allowed in which body slots. And when you design your own magic items, the affinities give you some guidance for what form a particular item should take.
</p><p>Some body slots have different affinities for different specific items.
