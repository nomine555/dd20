<p><em>Armor (<a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/shield/index.html">Shield</a>), rare (requires attunement)</em> </p>
<p>While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.  <br/>
<strong>Curse.</strong> This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/remove_curse/index.html">Remove Curse</a></em></strong> spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead. </p></div>
