<p><em>Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)</em> </p>
<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  <br/>
The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.</p></div>
