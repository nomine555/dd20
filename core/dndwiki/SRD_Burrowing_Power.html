<p>Your <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> sometimes bypass barriers.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Benefit">Benefit</span></h5>
<p>To use this <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>, you must expend your psionic focus. You can attempt to manifest your <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> against targets that are sheltered behind a wall or force effect. Your power briefly skips through the <a href="SRD_Astral_Plane.html" title="SRD:Astral Plane">Astral Plane</a> to bypass the barrier.
</p><p>The strength and thickness of the barrier determine your chance of success. To successfully bypass the barrier with your power, you make a <a href="SRD_Psicraft_Skill.html" title="SRD:Psicraft Skill">Psicraft</a> check against a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> equal to 10 + the hardness of the barrier + 1 per foot of thickness (minimum 1). Assign a hardness of 20 to barriers without a hardness rating, such as force effects (or a <i><a href="SRD_Wall_of_Ectoplasm.html" title="SRD:Wall of Ectoplasm">wall of ectoplasm</a></i>). Force walls or <i>walls of ectoplasm </i>are assumed to have less than 1 foot of thickness unless noted otherwise.
</p><p>If a power requires line of sight (which includes most <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> that affect a target or targets instead of an area), you cannot manifest it as a burrowing power unless you can somehow see the target, such as with <i><a href="SRD_Clairvoyant_Sense.html" title="SRD:Clairvoyant Sense">clairvoyant sense</a></i>. Using this <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> increases the <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power point</a> cost of the power by 2. The powerâ€™s total cost cannot exceed your <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>.
