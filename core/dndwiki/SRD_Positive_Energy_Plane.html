<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Positive_Energy_Plane">Positive Energy Plane</span></h3>
<p>The Positive Energy Plane has no surface and is akin to the <a href="SRD_Elemental_Plane_of_Air.html" title="SRD:Elemental Plane of Air">Elemental Plane of Air</a> with its wide-open nature. However, every bit of this plane glows brightly with innate power. This power is dangerous to mortal forms, which are not made to handle it. Despite the beneficial effects of the plane, it is one of the most hostile of the Inner Planes. An unprotected character on this plane swells with power as positive energy is force-fed into her. Then, her mortal frame unable to contain that power, she immolates as if she were a small planet caught at the edge of a supernova. Visits to the Positive Energy Plane are brief, and even then travelers must be heavily protected.
</p><p>The Positive Energy Plane has the following traits.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Subjective directional gravity.
</li>
<li>Major positive-dominant. Some regions of the plane have the minor positive-dominant trait instead, and those islands tend to be inhabited.
</li>
<li>Enhanced magic. Spells and <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like abilities</a> that use positive energy, including <i>cure </i>spells, are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> had been used on them, but the spells donâ€™t require higher-level slots). Spells and <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like abilities</a> that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">Class</a> abilities that use positive energy, such as turning and destroying <a href="SRD_Undead_Type.html" title="SRD:Undead Type">undead</a>, gain a +10 bonus on the roll to determine <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">Hit Dice</a> affected. (<a href="SRD_Undead_Type.html" title="SRD:Undead Type">Undead</a> are almost impossible to find on this plane, however.)
</li>
<li>Impeded magic. Spells and <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like abilities</a> that use negative energy (including <i>inflict </i>spells) are impeded.
</li>
</ul>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Random_Encounters">Random Encounters</span></h5>
<p>Because the Positive Energy Plane is virtually devoid of creatures, random encounters on the plane are exceedingly rare.
