<p><b>Necklace of Fireballs:</b> This device appears to be nothing but beads on a string, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character’s worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is—a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a <i><a href="SRD_Fireball.html" title="SRD:Fireball">fireball</a> </i>spell (<a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 14 half )<i>.</i>
</p><p>Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The market price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals.
</p><p>Each <i>necklace of fireballs </i>contains a combination of spheres of various strengths. Some traditional combinations, designated types I through VII, are detailed below.

<p>If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> against a magical fire attack, the item must make a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.
