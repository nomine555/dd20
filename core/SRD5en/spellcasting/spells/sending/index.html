<p><em>3rd-level evocation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Unlimited  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a short piece of fine copper wire)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round </p>
<p>You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/intelligence/index.html">Intelligence</a> scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.  <br/>
You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive. </p></div>
