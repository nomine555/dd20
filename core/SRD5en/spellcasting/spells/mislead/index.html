<p><em>5th-level illusion</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Self  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> S  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour </p>
<p>You become <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Invisible</a> at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.  <br/>
You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.  <br/>
You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Blinded</a> and <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Deafened</a> in regard to your own surroundings. </p></div>
