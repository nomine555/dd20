<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Full-Round_Actions">Full-Round Actions</span></h3>
<p>A full-round action requires an entire <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> to complete. Thus, it can’t be coupled with a standard or a <a href="SRD_Move_Actions.html" title="SRD:Move Actions">move action</a>, though if it does not involve moving any distance, you can take a <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:5-Foot_Step" title="SRD:5-Foot Step">5-foot step</a>.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Full_Attack">Full Attack</span></h4>
<p>If you get more than one attack per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> because your <a href="SRD_Base_Attack_Bonus.html" title="SRD:Base Attack Bonus" class="mw-redirect">base attack bonus</a> is high enough, because you fight with two weapons or a <a href="SRD_Double_Weapon.html" title="SRD:Double Weapon">double weapon</a> or for some special reason you must use a full-round action to get your additional attacks. You do not need to specify the targets of your attacks ahead of time. You can see how the earlier attacks turn out before assigning the later ones.
</p><p>The only movement you can take during a full attack is a <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:5-Foot_Step" title="SRD:5-Foot Step">5-foot step</a>. You may take the step before, after, or between your attacks.
</p><p>If you get multiple attacks because your <a href="SRD_Base_Attack_Bonus.html" title="SRD:Base Attack Bonus" class="mw-redirect">base attack bonus</a> is high enough, you must make the attacks in order from highest bonus to lowest. If you are using two weapons, you can strike with either weapon first. If you are using a <a href="SRD_Double_Weapon.html" title="SRD:Double Weapon">double weapon</a>, you can strike with either part of the weapon first.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Deciding_between_an_Attack_or_a_Full_Attack">Deciding between an Attack or a Full Attack</span></h5>
<p>After your first attack, you can decide to take a <a href="SRD_Move_Actions.html" title="SRD:Move Actions">move action</a> instead of making your remaining attacks, depending on how the first attack turns out. If you’ve already taken a <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:5-Foot_Step" title="SRD:5-Foot Step">5-foot step</a>, you can’t use your <a href="SRD_Move_Actions.html" title="SRD:Move Actions">move action</a> to move any distance, but you could still use a different kind of <a href="SRD_Move_Actions.html" title="SRD:Move Actions">move action</a>.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Fighting_Defensively_as_a_Full-Round_Action">Fighting Defensively as a Full-Round Action</span></h5>
<p>You can choose to fight defensively when taking a full attack action. If you do so, you take a –4 penalty on all attacks in a <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> to gain a +2 dodge bonus to <a href="SRD_AC.html" title="SRD:AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a> for the same <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Cleave">Cleave</span></h5>
<p>The extra attack granted by the Cleave <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> or Great Cleave <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> can be taken whenever they apply. This is an exception to the normal limit to the number of attacks you can take when not using a full attack action.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Cast_a_Spell">Cast a Spell</span></h4>
<p>A spell that takes 1 <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> to cast is a full-round action. It comes into effect just before the beginning of your turn in the <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> after you began casting the spell. You then act normally after the spell is completed.
</p><p>A spell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just before your turn 1 minute later (and for each of those 10 rounds, you are casting a spell as a full-round action). These actions must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or the spell automatically fails.
</p><p>When you begin a spell that takes 1 <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> or longer to cast, you must continue the invocations, gestures, and concentration from one <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> to just before your turn in the next <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> (at least). If you lose concentration after starting the spell and before it is complete, you lose the spell.
</p><p>You only provoke <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a> when you begin casting a spell, even though you might continue casting for at least one full <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. While casting a spell, you don’t threaten any squares around you.
</p><p>This action is otherwise identical to the cast a spell action described under Standard Actions.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Casting_a_Metamagic_Spell">Casting a Metamagic Spell</span></h5>
<p><a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">Sorcerers</a> and <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bards</a> must take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>) than a regular spell. If a spell’s normal casting time is 1 <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>, casting a metamagic version of the spell is a full-round action for a <a href="SRD_Sorcerer.html" title="SRD:Sorcerer">sorcerer</a> or <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a>. Note that this isn’t the same as a spell with a 1-round casting time—the spell takes effect in the same <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> that you begin casting, and you aren’t required to continue the invocations, gestures, and concentration until your next turn. For spells with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the metamagic spell.
</p><p><a href="SRD_Cleric.html" title="SRD:Cleric">Clerics</a> must take more time to spontaneously cast a metamagic version of a <i>cure </i>or <i>inflict </i>spell. Spontaneously casting a metamagic version of a spell with a casting time of 1 <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> is a full-round action, and spells with longer casting times take an extra full-round action to cast.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_Special_Ability">Use Special Ability</span></h4>
<p>Using a special ability is usually a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>, but some may be full-round actions, as defined by the ability.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Withdraw">Withdraw</span></h4>
<p>Withdrawing from melee combat is a full-round action. When you withdraw, you can move up to double your speed. The square you start out in is not considered threatened by any opponent you can see, and therefore visible enemies do not get <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a> against you when you move from that square. (<a href="SRD_Invisible.html" title="SRD:Invisible">Invisible</a> enemies still get <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a> against you, and you can’t withdraw from combat if you’re <a href="SRD_Blinded.html" title="SRD:Blinded">blinded</a>.) You can’t take a <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:5-Foot_Step" title="SRD:5-Foot Step">5-foot step</a> during the same <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> in which you withdraw.
</p><p>If, during the process of withdrawing, you move out of a threatened square (other than the one you started in), enemies get <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a> as normal.
</p><p>You may not withdraw using a form of movement for which you don’t have a listed speed.
</p><p>Note that despite the name of this action, you don’t actually have to leave combat entirely.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Restricted_Withdraw">Restricted Withdraw</span></h5>
<p>If you are limited to taking only a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> you can withdraw as a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>. In this case, you may move up to your speed (rather than up to double your speed).
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Run">Run</span></h4>
<p>You can run as a full-round action. (If you do, you do not also get a <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:5-Foot_Step" title="SRD:5-Foot Step">5-foot step</a>.) When you run, you can move up to four times your speed in a straight line (or three times your speed if you’re in heavy armor). You lose any <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dexterity</a> bonus to <a href="SRD_AC.html" title="SRD:AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a> unless you have the Run <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>
</p><p>You can run for a number of rounds equal to your <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a> score, but after that you must make a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 10 <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Constitution_Check" title="SRD:Constitution Check" class="mw-redirect">Constitution check</a> to continue running. You must check again each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> in which you continue to run, and the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> of this check increases by 1 for each check you have made. When you fail this check, you must stop running. A character who has run to his limit must rest for 1 minute (10 rounds) before running again. During a rest period, a character can move no faster than a normal <a href="SRD_Move_Actions.html" title="SRD:Move Actions">move action</a>.
</p><p>You can’t run across difficult terrain or if you can’t see where you’re going.
</p><p>A run represents a speed of about 12 miles per hour for an unencumbered human.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Move_5_Feet_through_Difficult_Terrain">Move 5 Feet through Difficult Terrain</span></h4>
<p>In some situations, your movement may be so hampered that you don’t have sufficient speed even to move 5 feet (a single square). In such a case, you may spend a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even diagonally. Even though this looks like a <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:5-Foot_Step" title="SRD:5-Foot Step">5-foot step</a>, it’s not, and thus it provokes <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a> normally.
