<p><b>Ring of Nine Facets: </b>This ring is set with a gem of nine facets, each one in-scribed with a different incomprehensible rune. Each day at sunrise, the gem turns to display a different facet. The active facet determines the <i>Ring's</i> power for that day. Each day, roll 1d10 to determine which facet (and thus which power) is active.

<p>The wearer of the <i>Ring </i>can, with a great deal of mental exertion, attempt to change the active facet away from one he or she does not desire. This requires a <a href="SRD_Full-Round_Actions.html" title="SRD:Full-Round Actions">full-round action</a> and a <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> check (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 50), and deals 2d6 points of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> regardless of success. If the save is successful, the new facet is determined randomly. If the <i>Ring </i>is removed, the former wearer takes 2d6 points of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> each minute until it is replaced or until his or her <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> exceeds his or her current <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> (though the <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> resumes again immediately when the former wearer regains consciousness).
