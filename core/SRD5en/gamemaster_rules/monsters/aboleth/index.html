<p><strong>Amphibious.</strong> The aboleth can breathe air and water.  <br/>
<strong>Mucous Cloud.</strong> While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by transformative mucus. A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 14 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw. On a failure, the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can breathe only underwater.  <br/>
<strong>Probing Telepathy.</strong> If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creature's greatest desires if the aboleth can see the creature. </p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.  <br/>
<strong>Tentacle.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature can't regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by heal or another disease-­‐curing spell of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.  <br/>
<strong>Tail.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 10 ft. one target. <em>Hit:</em> 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.  <br/>
<strong>Enslave (3/Day).</strong> The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> saving throw or be magically <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a> by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a> target is under the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.  <br/>
Whenever the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a> target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.    </p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The aboleth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The aboleth regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.  <br/>
<strong>Detect.</strong> The aboleth makes a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> (Perception) check.  <br/>
<strong>Tail Swipe.</strong> The aboleth makes one tail attack.  <br/>
<strong>Psychic Drain</strong> (Costs 2 Actions). One creature <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a> by the aboleth takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage the creature takes.</p></div>
