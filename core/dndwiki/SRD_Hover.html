<p>When flying, the creature can halt its forward motion and hover in place as a <a href="SRD_Move_Actions.html" title="SRD:Move Actions">move action</a>. It can then fly in any direction, including straight down or straight up, at half speed, regardless of its maneuverability.
</p><p>If a creature begins its turn hovering, it can hover in place for the turn and take a <a href="SRD_Full-Round_Actions.html" title="SRD:Full-Round Actions">full-round action</a>. A hovering creature cannot make wing attacks, but it can attack with all other limbs and appendages it could use in a full attack. The creature can instead use a breath weapon or cast a spell instead of making physical attacks, if it could normally do so.
</p><p>If a creature of Large size or larger hovers within 20 feet of the ground in an area with lots of loose debris, the draft from its wings creates a hemispherical cloud with a radius of 60 feet. The winds so generated can snuff torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and other small, open flames of non-magical origin. Clear vision within the cloud is limited to 10 feet. Creatures have <a href="SRD_Concealment.html" title="SRD:Concealment">concealment</a> at 15 to 20 feet (20% miss chance). At 25 feet or more, creatures have total <a href="SRD_Concealment.html" title="SRD:Concealment">concealment</a> (50% miss chance, and opponents cannot use sight to locate the creature).
</p><p>Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> check (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 10 + 1/2 creatureâ€™s <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">HD</a>) to cast a spell.
