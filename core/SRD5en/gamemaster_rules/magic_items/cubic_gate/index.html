<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="cubic-gate">Cubic Gate</h1>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em> </p>
<p>This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined by the GM.  <br/>
You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/gate/index.html">Gate</a></em></strong> spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/plane_shift/index.html">Plane Shift</a></em></strong> spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane keyed to that side.  <br/>
The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. </p></div>
