<p><em>Transmutation cantrip</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (mistletoe, a shamrock leaf, and a club or quarterstaff)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute </p>
<p>The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature's power. For the duration, you can use your <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/index.html#spellcasting">Spellcasting</a> ability instead of <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn't already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon. </p></div>
