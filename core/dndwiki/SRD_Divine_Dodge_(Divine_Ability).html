<p><b>Prerequisite:</b> <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dex</a> 29.
</p><p><b>Benefit:</b> Any physical attack or individually targeted spell directed at the deity has a percent miss chance equal to 50 + the deity’s rank. Area effects that include the deity have a similar chance to be ineffective.
</p><p><b>Notes:</b> The ability is similar to the <i><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Blink_(Spell)" title="SRD:Blink (Spell)" class="mw-redirect">blink</a> </i>spell, except that it is defensive only and the deity does not move to the <a href="SRD_Ethereal_Plane.html" title="SRD:Ethereal Plane">Ethereal Plane</a>, but simply exits from reality for a brief moment. This ability never interferes with the deity’s own attacks. If an attack overcomes the miss chance, the deity still gets the benefit of a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> (if one is allowed).
</p><p><b>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</b> Agility, gambling, luck, protection.
