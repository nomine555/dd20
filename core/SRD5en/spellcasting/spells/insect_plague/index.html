<p><em>5th-level conjuration</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 300 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes </p>
<p>Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere's area is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/combat/movement_and_position/index.html#difficult-terrain">Difficult Terrain</a>.  <br/>
When the area appears, each creature in it must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. </p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th. </p></div>
