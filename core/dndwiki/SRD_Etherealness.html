<p>Phase spiders and certain other creatures can exist on the Ethereal Plane. While on the Ethereal Plane, a creature is called ethereal. Unlike <a href="SRD_Incorporeal.html" title="SRD:Incorporeal">incorporeal</a> creatures, ethereal creatures are not present on the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>.
</p><p>Ethereal creatures are <a href="SRD_Invisible.html" title="SRD:Invisible">invisible</a>, inaudible, insubstantial, and scentless to creatures on the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>. Even most magical attacks have no effect on them. <a href="SRD_See_Invisibility.html" title="SRD:See Invisibility"><i>See invisibility</i></a> and <a href="SRD_True_Seeing.html" title="SRD:True Seeing"><i>true seeing</i></a> reveal ethereal creatures.
</p><p>An ethereal creature can see and hear into the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a> in a 60-foot radius, though material objects still block sight and sound. (An ethereal creature can’t see through a material wall, for instance.) An ethereal creature inside an object on the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a> cannot see. Things on the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>, however, look gray, indistinct, and ghostly. An ethereal creature can’t affect the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>, not even magically. An ethereal creature, however, interacts with other ethereal creatures and objects the way material creatures interact with material creatures and objects.
</p><p>Even if a creature on the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a> can see an ethereal creature the ethereal creature is on another plane. Only force effects can affect the ethereal creatures. If, on the other hand, both creatures are ethereal, they can affect each other normally.
</p><p>A force effect originating on the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a> extends onto the Ethereal Plane, so that a <a href="SRD_Wall_of_Force.html" title="SRD:Wall of Force"><i>wall of force</i></a> blocks an ethereal creature, and a <a href="SRD_Magic_Missile.html" title="SRD:Magic Missile"><i>magic missile</i></a> can strike one (provided the spellcaster can see the ethereal target). Gaze effects and abjurations also extend from the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a> to the Ethereal Plane. None of these effects extend from the Ethereal Plane to the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>.
</p><p>Ethereal creatures move in any direction (including up or down) at will. They do not need to walk on the ground, and material objects don’t block them (though they can’t see while their eyes are within solid material).
</p><p>Ghosts have a power called manifestation that allows them to appear on the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a> as <a href="SRD_Incorporeal.html" title="SRD:Incorporeal">incorporeal</a> creatures. Still, they are on the Ethereal Plane, and another ethereal creature can interact normally with a manifesting ghost. Ethereal creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as air. Ethereal creatures do not fall or take falling damage.
