<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Forest_Terrain">Forest Terrain</span></h3>
<p>Forest terrain can be divided into three categories: sparse, medium, and dense. An immense forest could have all three categories within its borders, with more sparse terrain at the outer edge of the forest and dense forest at its heart. 
</p><p>The table below describes in general terms how likely it is that a given square has a terrain element in it.

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Trees">Trees</span></h5>
<p>The most important terrain element in a forest is the trees, obviously. A creature standing in the same square as a tree gains a +2 bonus to <a href="SRD_Armor_Class.html" title="SRD:Armor Class">Armor Class</a> and a +1 bonus on <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> saves (these bonuses don’t stack with <a href="SRD_Cover.html" title="SRD:Cover">cover</a> bonuses from other sources). The presence of a tree doesn’t otherwise affect a creature’s fighting space, because it’s assumed that the creature is using the tree to its advantage when it can. The trunk of a typical tree has <a href="SRD_AC.html" title="SRD:AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a> 4, hardness 5, and 150 hp. A <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 <a href="SRD_Climb_Skill.html" title="SRD:Climb Skill">Climb</a> check is sufficient to climb a tree. Medium and dense forests have massive trees as well. These trees take up an entire square and provide <a href="SRD_Cover.html" title="SRD:Cover">cover</a> to anyone behind them. They have <a href="SRD_AC.html" title="SRD:AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a> 3, hardness 5, and 600 hp. Like their smaller counterparts, it takes a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 <a href="SRD_Climb_Skill.html" title="SRD:Climb Skill">Climb</a> check to climb them.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Undergrowth">Undergrowth</span></h5>
<p>Vines, roots, and short bushes <a href="SRD_Cover.html" title="SRD:Cover">cover</a> much of the ground in a forest. A space covered with light undergrowth costs 2 squares of movement to move into, and it provides <a href="SRD_Concealment.html" title="SRD:Concealment">concealment</a>. Undergrowth increases the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> of <a href="SRD_Tumble_Skill.html" title="SRD:Tumble Skill">Tumble</a> and <a href="SRD_Move_Silently_Skill.html" title="SRD:Move Silently Skill">Move Silently</a> checks by 2 because the leaves and branches get in the way. Heavy undergrowth costs 4 squares of movement to move into, and it provides <a href="SRD_Concealment.html" title="SRD:Concealment">concealment</a> with a 30% miss chance (instead of the usual 20%). It increases the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> of <a href="SRD_Tumble_Skill.html" title="SRD:Tumble Skill">Tumble</a> and <a href="SRD_Move_Silently_Skill.html" title="SRD:Move Silently Skill">Move Silently</a> checks by 5. Heavy undergrowth is easy to hide in, granting a +5 circumstance bonus on <a href="SRD_Hide_Skill.html" title="SRD:Hide Skill">Hide</a> checks. Running and charging are impossible. Squares with undergrowth are often clustered together. Undergrowth and trees aren’t mutually exclusive; it’s common for a 5-foot square to have both a tree and undergrowth.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Forest_Canopy">Forest Canopy</span></h5>
<p>It’s common for elves and other forest dwellers to live on raised platforms far above the surface floor. These wooden platforms generally have rope bridges between them. To get to the treehouses, characters generally ascend the trees’ branches (<a href="SRD_Climb_Skill.html" title="SRD:Climb Skill">Climb</a> <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15), use rope ladders (<a href="SRD_Climb_Skill.html" title="SRD:Climb Skill">Climb</a> <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 0), or take pulley elevators (which can be made to rise a number of feet equal to a <a href="SRD_Strength_Check.html" title="SRD:Strength Check" class="mw-redirect">Strength check</a>, made each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> as a <a href="SRD_Full-Round_Actions.html" title="SRD:Full-Round Actions">full-round action</a>). Creatures on platforms or branches in a forest canopy are considered to have <a href="SRD_Cover.html" title="SRD:Cover">cover</a> when fighting creatures on the ground, and in medium or dense forests they have <a href="SRD_Concealment.html" title="SRD:Concealment">concealment</a> as well.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_Forest_Terrain_Elements">Other Forest Terrain Elements</span></h5>
<p>Fallen logs generally stand about 3 feet high and provide <a href="SRD_Cover.html" title="SRD:Cover">cover</a> just as low walls do. They cost 5 feet of movement to cross. Forest streams are generally 5 to 10 feet wide and no more than 5 feet deep. Pathways wind through most forests, allowing normal movement and providing neither <a href="SRD_Cover.html" title="SRD:Cover">cover</a> nor <a href="SRD_Concealment.html" title="SRD:Concealment">concealment</a>. These paths are less common in dense forests, but even unexplored forests will have occasional game trails.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Stealth_and_Detection_in_a_Forest">Stealth and Detection in a Forest</span></h5>
<p>In a sparse forest, the maximum distance at which a <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html" title="SRD:Spot Skill">Spot</a> check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 3d6&#215;10 feet. In a medium forest, this distance is 2d8&#215;10 feet, and in a dense forest it is 2d6&#215;10 feet.
</p><p>Because any square with undergrowth provides <a href="SRD_Concealment.html" title="SRD:Concealment">concealment</a>, it’s usually easy for a creature to use the <a href="SRD_Hide_Skill.html" title="SRD:Hide Skill">Hide</a> skill in the forest. Logs and massive trees provide <a href="SRD_Cover.html" title="SRD:Cover">cover</a>, which also makes hiding possible.
</p><p>The background noise in the forest makes <a href="SRD_Listen_Skill.html" title="SRD:Listen Skill">Listen</a> checks more difficult, increasing the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> of the check by 2 per 10 feet, not 1 (but note that <a href="SRD_Move_Silently_Skill.html" title="SRD:Move Silently Skill">Move Silently</a> is also more difficult in undergrowth).
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Forest_Fires_.28CR_6.29">Forest Fires (<a href="SRD_CR.html" title="SRD:CR" class="mw-redirect">CR</a> 6)</span></h4>
<p>Most campfire sparks ignite nothing, but if conditions are dry, winds are strong, or the forest floor is dried out and flammable, a forest fire can result. Lightning strikes often set trees afire and start forest fires in this way. Whatever the cause of the fire, travelers can get caught in the conflagration.
</p><p>A forest fire can be spotted from as far away as 2d6&#215;100 feet by a character who makes a <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html" title="SRD:Spot Skill">Spot</a> check, treating the fire as a Colossal creature (reducing the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> by 16). If all characters fail their <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html" title="SRD:Spot Skill">Spot</a> checks, the fire moves closer to them. They automatically see it when it closes to half the original distance.
</p><p>Characters who are <a href="SRD_Blinded.html" title="SRD:Blinded">blinded</a> or otherwise unable to make <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html" title="SRD:Spot Skill">Spot</a> checks can feel the heat of the fire (and thus automatically “spot” it) when it is 100 feet away.
</p><p>The leading edge of a fire (the downwind side) can advance faster than a human can run (assume 120 feet per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> for winds of moderate strength). Once a particular portion of the forest is ablaze, it remains so for 2d4&#215;10 minutes before <a href="SRD_Dying.html" title="SRD:Dying">dying</a> to a smoking smolder. Characters overtaken by a forest fire may find the leading edge of the fire advancing away from them faster than they can keep up, trapping them deeper and deeper in its grasp.
</p><p>Within the bounds of a forest fire, a character faces three dangers: heat damage, catching on fire, and smoke inhalation. 
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Heat_Damage">Heat Damage</span></h5>
<p>Getting caught within a forest fire is even worse than being exposed to extreme heat (see Heat Dangers). Breathing the air causes a character to take 1d6 points of damage per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> (no save). In addition, a character must make a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save every 5 rounds (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a>. A character who holds his breath can avoid the lethal damage, but not the <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a>. Those wearing heavy clothing or any sort of armor take a –4 penalty on their <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throws</a>. In addition, those wearing metal armor or coming into contact with very hot metal are affected as if by a <i>heat metal </i>spell.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Catching_on_Fire">Catching on Fire</span></h5>
<p>Characters engulfed in a forest fire are at risk of catching on fire when the leading edge of the fire overtakes them, and are then at risk once per minute thereafter (see Catching on Fire).
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Smoke_Inhalation">Smoke Inhalation</span></h5>
<p>Forest fires naturally produce a great deal of smoke. A character who breathes heavy smoke must make a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15, +1 per previous check) or spend that <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> choking and coughing. A character who chokes for 2 consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a>. Also, smoke obscures vision, providing <a href="SRD_Concealment.html" title="SRD:Concealment">concealment</a> to characters within it.
