<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Environment">The Environment</span></h1>
<p>Environmental hazards specific to one kind of terrain (such as an avalanche, which occurs in the mountains) are described in Wilderness, above. Environmental hazards common to more than one setting are detailed below. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Acid_Effects">Acid Effects</span></h3>
<p>Corrosive acids deals 1d6 points of damage per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> of exposure except in the case of total immersion (such as into a vat of acid), which deals 10d6 points of damage per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. An attack with acid, such as from a hurled vial or a monster's spittle, counts as a <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> of exposure. The fumes from most acids are inhaled poisons. Those who come close enough to a large body of acid to dunk a creature in it must make a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 13 <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save or take 1 point of <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a> damage. All such characters must make a second save 1 minute later or take another 1d4 points of <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a> damage. 
Creatures immune to acid's caustic properties might still drown in it if they are totally immersed (see Drowning). 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cold_Dangers">Cold Dangers</span></h3>
<p>Cold and exposure deal <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> to the victim. This <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> cannot be recovered until the character gets out of the cold and warms up again. Once a character is rendered unconscious through the accumulation of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a>, the cold and exposure begins to deal lethal damage at the same rate. 
</p><p>An unprotected character in cold weather (below 40&#176; F) must make a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save each hour (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15, + 1 per previous check) or take 1d6 points of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a>. A character who has the <a href="SRD_Survival_Skill.html" title="SRD:Survival Skill">Survival</a> skill may receive a bonus on this <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> and may be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well (see the skill Description). 
</p><p>In conditions of severe cold or exposure (below 0&#176; F), an unprotected character must make a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save once every 10 minutes (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15, +1 per previous check), taking 1d6 points of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> on each failed save. A character who has the <a href="SRD_Survival_Skill.html" title="SRD:Survival Skill">Survival</a> skill may receive a bonus on this <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> and may be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well (see the skill description). Characters wearing winter clothing only need check once per hour for cold and exposure damage. 
A character who takes any <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> from cold or exposure is beset by frostbite or hypothermia (treat her as <a href="SRD_Fatigued.html" title="SRD:Fatigued">fatigued</a>). These penalties end when the character recovers the <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> she took from the cold and exposure. 
</p><p>Extreme cold (below -20&#176; F) deals 1d6 points of lethal damage per minute (no save). In addition, a character must make a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a>. Those wearing metal armor or coming into contact with very cold metal are affected as if by a <i><a href="SRD_Chill_Metal.html" title="SRD:Chill Metal">chill metal</a> </i>spell. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Ice_Effects">Ice Effects</span></h4>
<p>Characters walking on ice must spend 2 squares of movement to enter a square covered by ice, and the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> for <a href="SRD_Balance_Skill.html" title="SRD:Balance Skill">Balance</a> and <a href="SRD_Tumble_Skill.html" title="SRD:Tumble Skill">Tumble</a> checks increases by +5. Characters in prolonged contact with ice may run the risk of taking damage from severe cold (see above). 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Heat_Dangers">Heat Dangers</span></h3>
<p>Heat deals <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> that cannot be recovered until the character gets cooled off (reaches shade, survives until nightfall, gets doused in water, is targeted by <i>endure elements</i>, and so forth). Once rendered unconscious through the accumulation of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a>, the character begins to take lethal damage at the same rate. 
</p><p>A character in very hot conditions (above 90&#176; F) must make a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> each hour (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d4 points of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a>. Characters wearing heavy clothing or armor of any sort take a -4 penalty on their saves. A character with the <a href="SRD_Survival_Skill.html" title="SRD:Survival Skill">Survival</a> skill may receive a bonus on this <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> and may be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well (see the skill description). Characters reduced to unconsciousness begin taking lethal damage (1d4 points per hour). 
</p><p>In severe heat (above 110&#176; F), a character must make a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save once every 10 minutes (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d4 points of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a>. Characters wearing heavy clothing or armor of any sort take a -4 penalty on their saves. A character with the <a href="SRD_Survival_Skill.html" title="SRD:Survival Skill">Survival</a> skill may receive a bonus on this <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> and may be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well. Characters reduced to unconsciousness begin taking lethal damage (1d4 points per each 10-minute period). 
</p><p>A character who takes any <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> from heat exposure now suffers from heatstroke and is <a href="SRD_Fatigued.html" title="SRD:Fatigued">fatigued</a>.
</p><p>These penalties end when the character recovers the <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> she took from the heat. 
</p><p>Extreme heat (air temperature over 140&#176; F, fire, boiling water, lava) deals lethal damage. Breathing air in these temperatures deals 1d6 points of damage per minute (no save). In addition, a character must make a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save every 5 minutes (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a>. Those wearing heavy clothing or any sort of armor take a -4 penalty on their saves. In addition, those wearing metal armor or coming into contact with very hot metal are affected as if by a <i><a href="SRD_Heat_Metal.html" title="SRD:Heat Metal">heat metal</a> </i>spell. 
</p><p>Boiling water deals 1d6 points of scalding damage, unless the character is fully immersed, in which case it deals 10d6 points of damage per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> of exposure. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Catching_on_Fire">Catching on Fire</span></h4>
<p>Characters exposed to burning oil, bonfires, and non-instantaneous magic fires might find their clothes, hair, or equipment on fire. Spells with an instantaneous duration don't normally set a character on fire, since the heat and flame from these come and go in a flash. 
</p><p>Characters at risk of catching fire are allowed a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> save to avoid this fate. If a character's clothes or hair catch fire, he takes 1d6 points of damage immediately. In each subsequent <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, the burning character must make another <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a>. Failure means he takes another 1d6 points of damage that <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. Success means that the fire has gone out. (That is, once he succeeds on his <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a>, he's no longer on fire.)
</p><p>A character on fire may automatically extinguish the flames by jumping into enough water to douse himself. If no body of water is at hand, rolling on the ground or smothering the fire with cloaks or the like permits the character another save with a +4 bonus.
</p><p>Those unlucky enough to have their clothes or equipment catch fire must make <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> saves for each item. Flammable items that fail take the same amount of damage as the character. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Lava_Effects">Lava Effects</span></h4>
<p>Lava or magma deals 2d6 points of damage per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> of exposure, except in the case of total immersion (such as when a character falls into the crater of an active volcano), which deals 20d6 points of damage per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. 
</p><p>Damage from magma continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half of that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 10d6 points per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>). 
</p><p>An immunity or resistance to fire serves as an immunity to lava or magma. However, a creature immune to fire might still drown if completely immersed in lava (see Drowning, below). 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Smoke_Effects">Smoke Effects</span></h3>
<p>A character who breathes heavy smoke must make a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15, +1 per previous check) or spend that <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> choking and coughing. A character who chokes for 2 consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a>. 
</p><p>Smoke obscures vision, giving <a href="SRD_Concealment.html" title="SRD:Concealment">concealment</a> (20% miss chance) to characters within it. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Starvation_and_Thirst">Starvation and Thirst</span></h3>
<p>Characters might find themselves without food or water and with no means to obtain them. In normal climates, Medium characters need at least a gallon of fluids and about a pound of decent food per day to avoid starvation. (Small characters need half as much.) In very hot climates, characters need two or three times as much water to avoid dehydration. 
</p><p>A character can go without water for 1 day plus a number of hours equal to his <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a> score. After this time, the character must make a <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Constitution_Check" title="SRD:Constitution Check" class="mw-redirect">Constitution check</a> each hour (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 10, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a>. 
</p><p>A character can go without food for 3 days, in growing discomfort. After this time, the character must make a <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Constitution_Check" title="SRD:Constitution Check" class="mw-redirect">Constitution check</a> each day (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 10, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a>. 
</p><p>Characters who have taken <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> from lack of food or water are <a href="SRD_Fatigued.html" title="SRD:Fatigued">fatigued</a>. <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">Nonlethal damage</a> from thirst or starvation cannot be recovered until the character gets food or water, as needed.*
</p><p>* Not even magic that restores <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> heals this damage.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Suffocation">Suffocation</span></h3>
<p>A character who has no air to breathe can hold her breath for 2 rounds per point of <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a>. After this period of time, the character must make a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 10 <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Constitution_Check" title="SRD:Constitution Check" class="mw-redirect">Constitution check</a> in order to continue holding her breath. The save must be repeated each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, with the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> increasing by +1 for each previous success. 
</p><p>When the character fails one of these <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Constitution_Check" title="SRD:Constitution Check" class="mw-redirect">Constitution checks</a>, she begins to suffocate. In the first <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, she falls unconscious (0 <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>). In the following <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, she drops to -1 <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> and is <a href="SRD_Dying.html" title="SRD:Dying">dying</a>. In the third <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, she suffocates. 
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Slow_Suffocation">Slow Suffocation</span></h5>
<p>A Medium character can breathe easily for 6 hours in a sealed chamber measuring 10 feet on a side. After that time, the character takes 1d6 points of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> every 15 minutes. Each additional Medium character or significant fire source (a torch, for example) proportionally reduces the time the air will last. <span class="errata">When a character falls unconscious from this <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a>, she drops to –1 <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> and is <a href="SRD_Dying.html" title="SRD:Dying">dying</a>. In the next <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, she suffocates.</span>
</p><p>Small characters consume half as much air as Medium characters. A larger volume of air, of course, lasts for a longer time.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Water_Dangers">Water Dangers</span></h3>
<p>Any character can wade in relatively calm water that isn't over his head, no check required. Similarly, swimming in calm water only requires <a href="SRD_Skill_Check.html" title="SRD:Skill Check" class="mw-redirect">skill checks</a> with a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> of 10. Trained swimmers can just take 10. (Remember, however, that armor or heavy gear makes any attempt at swimming much more difficult. See the <a href="SRD_Swim_Skill.html" title="SRD:Swim Skill">Swim</a> skill description.) 
</p><p>By contrast, fast-moving water is much more dangerous. On a successful <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 <a href="SRD_Swim_Skill.html" title="SRD:Swim Skill">Swim</a> check or a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 <a href="SRD_Strength_Check.html" title="SRD:Strength Check" class="mw-redirect">Strength check</a>, it deals 1d3 points of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> (1d6 points of lethal damage if flowing over rocks and cascades). On a failed check, the character must make another check that <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> to avoid going under. 
</p><p>Very deep water is not only generally pitch black, posing a navigational hazard, but worse, it deals water pressure damage of 1d6 points per minute for every 100 feet the character is below the surface. A successful <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15, +1 for each previous check) means the diver takes no damage in that minute. Very cold water deals 1d6 points of <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> from hypothermia per minute of exposure. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Drowning"><span id="Drowning">Drowning</span></span></h4>
<p>Any character can hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to twice her <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a> score. After this period of time, the character must make a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 10 <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Constitution_Check" title="SRD:Constitution Check" class="mw-redirect">Constitution check</a> every <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> in order to continue holding her breath. Each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> increases by 1.   
</p><p>When the character finally fails her <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Constitution_Check" title="SRD:Constitution Check" class="mw-redirect">Constitution check</a>, she begins to drown. In the first <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, she falls unconscious (0 hp). In the following <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, she drops to -1 <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> and is <a href="SRD_Dying.html" title="SRD:Dying">dying</a>. In the third <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, she drowns. 
</p><p>It is possible to drown in substances other than water, such as sand, quicksand, fine dust, and silos full of grain.
