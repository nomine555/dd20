<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Concentration_.28Con.29">Concentration (<a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Con</a>)</span></h3>
<p>You are particularly good at focusing your mind. 
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Check">Check</span></h5>
<p>You must make a Concentration check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that requires your full attention. Such actions include casting a spell, manifesting a power, concentrating on an active spell or power, directing a spell or power, using a spell-like or <a href="SRD_Psi-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Psi-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">psi-like ability</a>, or using a skill that would provoke an <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attack of opportunity</a>. In general, if an action wouldn’t normally provoke an <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attack of opportunity</a>, you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being distracted.
</p><p>If the Concentration check succeeds, you may continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of casting a spell, the spell is lost. If you were in the process of manifesting a power, the <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> are lost. If you were concentrating on an active spell or power, the spell or power ends as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were directing a spell or power, the direction fails but the spell or power remains active. If you were using a spell- or <a href="SRD_Psi-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Psi-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">psi-like ability</a>, that use of the ability is lost. A skill use also fails, and in some cases a failed <a href="SRD_Skill_Check.html" title="SRD:Skill Check" class="mw-redirect">skill check</a> may have other ramifications as well.
</p><p>The table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make a Concentration check. If the distraction occurs while you are trying to cast a spell, you must add the level of the spell you are trying to cast to the appropriate Concentration <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a>. If more than one type of distraction is present, make a check for each one; any failed Concentration check indicates that the task is not completed.

<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Gain_Psionic_Focus">Gain Psionic Focus</span></h6>
<p>Merely holding a reservoir of psionic <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> in mind gives psionic characters a special energy. Psionic characters can put that energy to work without actually paying a <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power point</a> cost—they can become psionically focused as a special use of the Concentration skill.
</p><p>If you have 1 or more <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> available, you can meditate to attempt to become psionically focused. The <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> to become psionically focused is 20. Meditating is a <a href="SRD_Full-Round_Actions.html" title="SRD:Full-Round Actions">full-round action</a> that provokes <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a>. When you are psionically focused, you can expend your focus on any single Concentration check you make thereafter. When you expend your focus in this manner, your Concentration check is treated as if you rolled a 15. It’s like taking 10, except that the number you add to your Concentration modifier is 15. You can also expend your focus to gain the benefit of a psionic <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>—many psionic <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a> are activated in this way.
</p><p>Once you are psionically focused, you remain focused until you expend your focus, become unconscious, or go to sleep (or enter a meditative trance, in the case of elans), or until your <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power point</a> reserve drops to 0.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Epic_Check">Epic Check</span></h5>
<p>You can cast spells with somatic components even while <a href="SRD_Grappling.html" title="SRD:Grappling">grappled</a>.  (See table.)
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Action">Action</span></h5>
<p>None. Making a Concentration check doesn’t take an action; it is either a <a href="SRD_Free_Actions.html" title="SRD:Free Actions">free action</a> (when attempted reactively) or part of another action (when attempted actively). Meditating to gain psionic focus is a <a href="SRD_Full-Round_Actions.html" title="SRD:Full-Round Actions">full-round action</a>.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Try_Again">Try Again</span></h5>
<p>Yes, though a success doesn’t cancel the effect of a previous failure, such as the loss of a spell you were casting, the loss of the <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> for a power being manifested, or the disruption of a spell or power you were concentrating on.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Special">Special</span></h5>
<p>You can use Concentration to cast a spell, manifest a power, use a spell- or <a href="SRD_Psi-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Psi-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">psi-like ability</a>, or use a skill defensively, so as to avoid <a href="SRD_Attacks_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attacks of Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a> altogether. This doesn’t apply to other actions that might provoke <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a>.
</p><p>The <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> of the check is 15 (plus the spell or power’s level, if casting a spell, manifesting a power, or using a spell- or <a href="SRD_Psi-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Psi-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">psi-like ability</a> defensively). If the Concentration check succeeds, you may attempt the action normally without provoking any <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a>. A successful Concentration check still doesn’t allow you to take 10 on another check if you are in a stressful situation; you must make the check normally. If the Concentration check fails, the related action also automatically fails (with any appropriate ramifications), and the action is wasted, just as if your concentration had been disrupted by a distraction.
</p><p>A character with the <a href="SRD_Combat_Casting.html" title="SRD:Combat Casting">Combat Casting</a> <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> gets a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to cast a spell or use a <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like ability</a> while on the defensive or while <a href="SRD_Grappling.html" title="SRD:Grappling">grappling</a> or <a href="SRD_Pinned.html" title="SRD:Pinned">pinned</a>.
</p><p>A character with the <a href="SRD_Combat_Manifestation.html" title="SRD:Combat Manifestation">Combat Manifestation</a> <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> gets a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to manifest a power or use a <a href="SRD_Psi-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Psi-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">psi-like ability</a> while on the defensive or while <a href="SRD_Grappling.html" title="SRD:Grappling">grappling</a> or <a href="SRD_Pinned.html" title="SRD:Pinned">pinned</a>.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Synergy">Synergy</span></h5>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Concentration, you get a +2 bonus on <a href="SRD_Autohypnosis_Skill.html" title="SRD:Autohypnosis Skill">Autohypnosis</a> checks.
