<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="fabricate">Fabricate</h1>
<p><em>4th-level transmutation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p>You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool.  <br/>
Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the spell is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.  <br/>
Creatures or magic items can't be created or transmuted by this spell. You also can't use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan's tools used to craft such objects. </p></div>
