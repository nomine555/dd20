<p>Use this skill to activate psionic devices, including <a href="SRD_Power_Stones.html" title="SRD:Power Stones">power stones</a> (chunks of crystal that store specific <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>) and <a href="SRD_Dorjes.html" title="SRD:Dorjes">dorjes</a> (slender crystal wands charged with several uses of the same power), that otherwise you could not activate.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Check">Check</span></h5>
<p>You can use this skill to address a power stone (to learn what <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> are encoded on it) or to activate a psionic item. This skill lets you use a psionic item as if you had the manifesting ability or <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> features of another <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a>, as if you were a different race, or as if you were a different alignment.
</p><p>You make Use Psionic Device checks each time you activate a device such as a dorje. If you are using the check to emulate an alignment or some other quality in an ongoing manner, you need to make the relevant emulation checks once per hour.
</p><p>You must consciously choose what to emulate. That is, you must know what you are trying to emulate when you make an emulation check. The <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DCs</a> for various tasks involving Use Psionic Device are summarized on the table below.

<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Activate_Blindly">Activate Blindly</span></h6>
<p>Some psionic items are activated by special specific thoughts or conceptions. You can activate such items as if you were using the activation method, even if you’re not and even if you don’t know it. You do have to use something equivalent. You have to wave the item around or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a special +2 bonus if you’ve activated the item at least once before.
</p><p>If you fail the check by 10 or more, you suffer brainburn. This brainburn affects you in the same way as brainburn that can occur when you attempt to manifest a power from a power stone, except that the damage is 1d4 points per power level instead of 1d6. Brainburn damage from activating blindly is in addition to brainburn damage from manifesting a power from a power stone.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Address_a_Power_Stone">Address a Power Stone</span></h6>
<p>Successfully addressing a power stone allows you to find out what power or <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> it contains. Doing this requires 1 minute of concentration.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Emulate_an_Ability_Score">Emulate an Ability Score</span></h6>
<p>To manifest a power from a <a href="SRD_Power_Stones.html" title="SRD:Power Stones">power stone</a>, you need a high <a href="SRD_Ability_Scores.html" title="SRD:Ability Scores">ability score</a> in the appropriate ability. Your effective <a href="SRD_Ability_Scores.html" title="SRD:Ability Scores">ability score</a> (appropriate to the <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> you’re emulating when you try to manifest the power from the power stone) is your check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don’t need to make this check.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Emulate_an_Alignment">Emulate an Alignment</span></h6>
<p>Some psionic items have positive or negative effects based on your alignment. Use Psionic Device lets you use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You can emulate only one alignment at a time. 
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Emulate_a_Class_Feature">Emulate a <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">Class</a> Feature</span></h6>
<p>Sometimes you need to use a <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> feature to activate a psionic item. Your effective level in the emulated <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> equals your check result minus 20. This skill does not let you use the <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> feature of another <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a>. It just lets you activate items as if you had the <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> feature.
</p><p>If the <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate alignment as a separate check (see above).
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Emulate_a_Race">Emulate a Race</span></h6>
<p>Some psionic items work only for certain races, or work better for those of certain races. You can use such an item as if you were a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a time.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_a_Dorje">Use a Dorje</span></h6>
<p>Normally, to use a <a href="SRD_Dorjes.html" title="SRD:Dorjes">dorje</a>, you must have the dorje’s power on your <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> power list. This use of the skill allows you to use a dorje as if you had a particular power on your <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> power list. This use of the skill applies to other power trigger psionic items, if applicable.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_a_Power_Stone">Use a Power Stone</span></h6>
<p>Normally, to manifest a power from a <a href="SRD_Power_Stones.html" title="SRD:Power Stones">power stone</a>, you must have the power stone’s power on your <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> power list. This use of the skill allows you to use a power stone as if you had a particular power on your <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> power list. The <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> is equal to 20 + the <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a> of the power you are trying to manifest from the power stone. <i>Note: </i>Before you use a power stone, you must first have addressed it to determine what <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> it contains. In addition, manifesting a power from a power stone requires a minimum score (10 + power level) in the appropriate ability. If you don’t have a high enough score, you must emulate the <a href="SRD_Ability_Scores.html" title="SRD:Ability Scores">ability score</a> with a separate check (see above). This use of the skill applies to other power completion psionic items.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Action">Action</span></h5>
<p>None. The Use Psionic Device check is made as part of the action (if any) required to activate the psionic item.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Try_Again">Try Again</span></h5>
<p>Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and you fail, you can’t try to activate it again for a day.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Special">Special</span></h5>
<p>You cannot take 10 with this skill.
</p><p>You can’t aid another on Use Psionic Device checks. Only the user of the item can attempt such a check.
</p><p>A character with the <a href="SRD_Psionic_Affinity.html" title="SRD:Psionic Affinity">Psionic Affinity</a> <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> gets a +2 bonus on Use Psionic Device checks.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Synergy">Synergy</span></h5>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in <a href="SRD_Psicraft_Skill.html" title="SRD:Psicraft Skill">Psicraft</a>, you get a +2 bonus on Use Psionic Device checks related to <a href="SRD_Power_Stones.html" title="SRD:Power Stones">power stones</a>.
</p><p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Psionic Device, you get a +2 bonus on <a href="SRD_Psicraft_Skill.html" title="SRD:Psicraft Skill">Psicraft</a> checks to address <a href="SRD_Power_Stones.html" title="SRD:Power Stones">power stones</a>.
