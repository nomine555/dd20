<p><em>1st-level illusion</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Self (15-foot cone) <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round </p>
<p>A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Unconscious</a> creatures and creatures that can't see).  <br/>
Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Blinded</a> until the spell ends. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected. </p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st. </p></div>
