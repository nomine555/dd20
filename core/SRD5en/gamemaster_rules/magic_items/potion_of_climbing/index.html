<p><em>Potion, common</em> </p>
<p>When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a> on <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> (Athletics) checks you make to <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/index.html#climb">Climb</a>. The potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors. </p></div>
