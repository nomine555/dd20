<p>You collapse a bit of time from the continuum, forming a 1-ounce dollop of thick, gooey material called quintessence. This substance shimmers like a silver mirror when viewed from some angles but is transparent from other viewpoints. You can smooth a dollop of quintessence around any extremely small object.
</p><p>Objects sealed within quintessence are protected from the effects of time; in practical terms, they enter a state of stasis. Living flesh with only partial contact with quintessence is also partially pulled out of the time stream (the manifester is immune to this effect). This disruption deals 1 point of damage per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> beginning 10 rounds after partial contact occurs.
</p><p>Quintessence can be manually scraped away from a protected object, freeing it to rejoin the time stream. When you do this, there is a 75% chance that the quintessence evaporates back into the continuum. Otherwise, it coalesces again into a 1-inch-diameter bead, available for later use.
</p><p>Large quantities of quintessence could theoretically be gathered to preserve large items or structures (or even a complete living creature; if completely immersed, a living creature would not take the damage associated with partial contact). However, psionic characters and creatures are generally loath to do so because accumulations of quintessence weighing 1 pound or more hinder psionic activity within a 5-foot radius of the accumulation: <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">Powers</a> require twice as many <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> to manifest, unless the manifester makes a successful <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Will</a> save <span class="errata">(<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 16)</span> each time he or she attempts to manifest a power. Also in these circumstances, manifesting a <a href="SRD_Psi-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Psi-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">psi-like ability</a> that is usable at will is a <a href="SRD_Full-Round_Actions.html" title="SRD:Full-Round Actions">full-round action</a> rather than a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>.
