The periapt doubles the wearer’s normal rate of healing or allows normal healing of wounds that would not do so normally. Hit point damage that involves bleeding is negated for the wearer of the periapt, but he is still susceptible to damage from bleeding that causes <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a> loss, such as that dealt by a <a href="SRD_Wounding.html" title="SRD:Wounding">wounding weapon</a>.
