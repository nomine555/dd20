<p><em>4th-level enchantment</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (three nut shells)  <br/>

<p>This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.  <br/>
An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn. </p>

<p>At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target. </p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th. </p></div>
