<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="restorative-ointment">Restorative Ointment</h1>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em> </p>
<p>This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4 + 1 doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound.  <br/>
As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains 2d8 + 2 hit points, ceases to be <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Poisoned</a>, and is cured of any disease. </p></div>
