<p><em>Armor (<a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/shield/index.html">Shield</a>), rare (requires attunement)</em> </p>
<p>You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead. </p></div>
