<p>You can manifest a power simultaneously with another power just like it.

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Benefit">Benefit</span></h5>
<p>To use this <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>, you must expend your psionic focus. You can twin a power. Manifesting a power altered by this <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> causes the power to take effect twice on the area or target, as if you were simultaneously manifesting the same power two times on the same location or target. Any variables in the power (such as duration, number of targets, and so on) are the same for both of the resulting <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>. The target experiences all the effects of both <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> individually and receives a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> (if applicable) for each. In some cases, such as a twinned <i><a href="SRD_Psionic_Charm.html" title="SRD:Psionic Charm">psionic charm</a></i>, failing both <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throws</a> results in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target from the charm effect).
</p><p>Using this <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> increases the <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power point</a> cost of the power by 6. The powerâ€™s total cost cannot exceed your <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>.
