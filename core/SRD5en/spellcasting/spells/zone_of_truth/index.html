<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="zone-of-truth">Zone of Truth</h1>
<p><em>2nd-level enchantment</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes </p>
<p>You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/charisma/index.html">Charisma</a> saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.  <br/>
An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.</p></div>
