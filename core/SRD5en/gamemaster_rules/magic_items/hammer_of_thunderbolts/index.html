<p><em>Weapon (maul), legendary</em> </p>
<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  <br/>
<strong>Giant's Bane (Requires Attunement).(()) You must be wearing a </strong>belt of giant <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a><strong> (any variety) and </strong>gauntlets of <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/ogre/index.html">Ogre</a> power** to attune to this weapon. The attunement ends if you take off either of those items. While you are attuned to this weapon and holding it, your <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> score increases by 4 and can exceed 20, but not 30. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 17 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw or die. <br/>
The hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw or be <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Stunned</a> until the end of your next turn. The hammer regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. </p></div>
