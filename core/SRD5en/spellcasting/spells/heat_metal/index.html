<p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a piece of iron and a flame)  <br/>

<p>Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.  <br/>
If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn. </p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd. </p></div>
