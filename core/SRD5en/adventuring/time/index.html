<p>In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a scale of <strong>minutes</strong>. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/traps/index.html">Traps</a> on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.  <br/>
In a city or wilderness, a scale of <strong>hours</strong> is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours' time.   <br/>
For long journeys, a scale of <strong>days</strong> works best. Following the road from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/goblin/index.html">Goblin</a> ambush interrupts their journey. <br/>
In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on <strong>rounds</strong>, a 6-second span of time.</p></div>
