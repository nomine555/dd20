<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Psicrystal_Containment_.5BPsionic.5D">Psicrystal Containment [Psionic]</span></h3>
<p>Your psicrystal has advanced enough that it can hold a psionic focus that you store within it.

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Benefit">Benefit</span></h5>
<p>You can spend a <a href="SRD_Full-Round_Actions.html" title="SRD:Full-Round Actions">full-round action</a> attempting to psionically focus your <a href="SRD_Psion.html#Psicrystals" title="SRD:Psion">psicrystals</a>. At any time when you need to expend your psionic focus, you can expend your psicrystal’s psionic focus instead, as long as the crystal is within 5 feet of you. Psionically focusing your psicrystal works just like focusing yourself. The psicrystal cannot focus itself—only the owner can spend the time to focus the crystal.
