<p>A creature with cold immunity never takes cold damage. It has vulnerability to fire, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.
