<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="sunburst">Sunburst</h1>
<p><em>8th-level evocation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (fire and a piece of sunstone)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p>Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Blinded</a> for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Blinded</a> by this spell. Undead and oozes have <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> on this saving throw.  <br/>
A creature <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Blinded</a> by this spell makes another <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Blinded</a>.  <br/>
This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell. </p></div>
