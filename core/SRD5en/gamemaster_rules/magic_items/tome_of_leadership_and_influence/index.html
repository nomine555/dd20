<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em> </p>
<p>This book contains guidelines for influencing and charming others, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/charisma/index.html">Charisma</a> score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century. </p></div>
