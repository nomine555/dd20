<p><b>Djinni Calling: </b>One of the many rings of fable, this “genie” ring is most useful indeed. It serves as a special <i><a href="SRD_Gate.html" title="SRD:Gate">gate</a> </i>by means of which a specific djinni can be called from the <a href="SRD_Elemental_Plane_of_Air.html" title="SRD:Elemental Plane of Air">Elemental Plane of Air</a>. When the ring is rubbed (a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>), the call goes out, and the djinni appears on the next <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. The djinni faithfully obeys and serves the wearer of the ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the djinni of the ring is ever killed, the ring becomes nonmagical and worthless.
