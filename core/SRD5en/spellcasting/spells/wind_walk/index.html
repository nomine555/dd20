<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="wind-walk">Wind Walk</h1>
<p><em>6th-level transmutation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (fire and holy water)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours </p>
<p>You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Incapacitated</a> and can't move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.  <br/>
If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance. </p></div>
