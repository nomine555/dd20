<p>When adventurers pursue <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/sahuagin/index.html">Sahuagin</a> back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply. <br/>
When making a <strong>melee weapon attack</strong>, a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.  <br/>
A <strong>ranged weapon attack</strong> automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has <a href="../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).  <br/>
Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.</p></div>
