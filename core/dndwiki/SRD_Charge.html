<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Charge">Charge</span></h3>
<p>Charging is a special <a href="SRD_Full-Round_Actions.html" title="SRD:Full-Round Actions">full-round action</a> that allows you to move up to twice your speed and attack during the action. However, it carries tight restrictions on how you can move.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Movement_During_a_Charge">Movement During a Charge</span></h5>
<p>You must move before your attack, not after. You must move at least 10 feet (2 squares) and may move up to double your speed directly toward the designated opponent.
</p><p>You must have a clear path toward the opponent, and nothing can hinder your movement (such as difficult terrain or obstacles). Here’s what it means to have a clear path. First, you must move to the closest space from which you can attack the opponent. (If this space is occupied or otherwise blocked, you can’t charge.) Second, if any line from your starting space to the ending space passes through a square that blocks movement, slows movement, or contains a creature (even an ally), you can’t charge. (<a href="SRD_Helpless.html" title="SRD:Helpless">Helpless</a> creatures don’t stop a charge.)
</p><p>If you don’t have line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn, you can’t charge that opponent.
</p><p>You can’t take a <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:5-Foot_Step" title="SRD:5-Foot Step">5-foot step</a> in the same <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> as a charge.
</p><p>If you are able to take only a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> or a <a href="SRD_Move_Actions.html" title="SRD:Move Actions">move action</a> on your turn, you can still charge, but you are only allowed to move up to your speed (instead of up to double your speed). You can’t use this option unless you are restricted to taking only a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> or <a href="SRD_Move_Actions.html" title="SRD:Move Actions">move action</a> on your turn.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Attacking_on_a_Charge">Attacking on a Charge</span></h5>
<p>After moving, you may make a single <a href="SRD_Melee_Attack.html" title="SRD:Melee Attack" class="mw-redirect">melee attack</a>. You get a +2 bonus on the <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack roll</a> and take a –2 penalty to your <a href="SRD_AC.html" title="SRD:AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a> until the start of your next turn.
</p><p>A charging character gets a +2 bonus on the <a href="SRD_Strength_Check.html" title="SRD:Strength Check" class="mw-redirect">Strength check</a> made to <a href="SRD_Bull_Rush.html" title="SRD:Bull Rush">bull rush</a> an opponent.
</p><p>Even if you have extra attacks, such as from having a high enough <a href="SRD_Base_Attack_Bonus.html" title="SRD:Base Attack Bonus" class="mw-redirect">base attack bonus</a> or from using multiple weapons, you only get to make one attack during a charge.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Lances_and_Charge_Attacks">Lances and Charge Attacks</span></h5>
<p>A lance deals double damage if employed by a mounted character in a charge.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Weapons_Readied_against_a_Charge">Weapons Readied against a Charge</span></h5>
<p>Spears, tridents, and certain other piercing weapons deal double damage when readied (set) and used against a charging character.
