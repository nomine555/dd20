<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em> </p>
<p>These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the <strong><em>*C<a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/harm/index.html">Harm</a> Person*</em></strong> spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn. </p></div>
