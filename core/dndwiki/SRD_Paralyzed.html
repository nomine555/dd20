<p>A paralyzed character is frozen in place and unable to move or act. A paralyzed character has effective <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dexterity</a> and <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> scores of 0 and is <a href="SRD_Helpless.html" title="SRD:Helpless">helpless</a>, but can take purely mental actions. A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A paralyzed swimmer can’t swim and may drown. A creature can move through a space occupied by a paralyzed creature—ally or not. Each square occupied by a paralyzed creature, however, counts as 2 squares.
