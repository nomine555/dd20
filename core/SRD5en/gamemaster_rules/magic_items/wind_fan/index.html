<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="wind-fan">Wind Fan</h1>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em> </p>
<p>While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/gust_of_wind/index.html">Gust of Wind</a></em></strong> spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn't be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters. </p></div>
