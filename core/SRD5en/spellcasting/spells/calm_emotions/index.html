<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="calm-emotions">Calm Emotions</h1>
<p><em>2nd-level enchantment</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute </p>
<p>You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/charisma/index.html">Charisma</a> saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.  <br/>
You can suppress any effect causing a target to be <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a> or <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Frightened</a>. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime. <br/>
Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise. </p></div>
