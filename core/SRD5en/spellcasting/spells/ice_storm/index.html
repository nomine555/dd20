<p><em>4th-level evocation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 300 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p>A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20- foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  <br/>
Hailstones turn the storm's area of effect into <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/combat/movement_and_position/index.html#difficult-terrain">Difficult Terrain</a> until the end of your next turn. </p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th. </p></div>
