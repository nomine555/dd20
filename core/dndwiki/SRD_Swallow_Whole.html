<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Swallow_Whole_.28Ex.29">Swallow Whole (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ex" title="SRD:Ex" class="mw-redirect">Ex</a>)</span></h3>
<p>If a creature with this special attack begins its turn with an opponent held in its mouth (see Improved Grab), it can attempt a new <a href="SRD_Grapple.html" title="SRD:Grapple">grapple</a> check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, it swallows its prey, and the opponent takes bite damage. Unless otherwise noted, the opponent can be up to one <a href="SRD_Size_Category.html" title="SRD:Size Category" class="mw-redirect">size category</a> smaller than the swallowing creature. Being swallowed has various consequences, depending on the creature doing the swallowing. A swallowed creature is considered to be <a href="SRD_Grappling.html" title="SRD:Grappling">grappled</a>, while the creature that did the swallowing is not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting damage required to get free is noted in the creature description), or it can just try to escape the <a href="SRD_Grapple.html" title="SRD:Grapple">grapple</a>. The <a href="SRD_Armor_Class.html" title="SRD:Armor Class">Armor Class</a> of the interior of a creature that swallows whole is normally 10 + 1/2 its <a href="SRD_Natural_Armor_Bonus.html" title="SRD:Natural Armor Bonus" class="mw-redirect">natural armor bonus</a>, with no modifiers for size or <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dexterity</a>. If the swallowed creature escapes the <a href="SRD_Grapple.html" title="SRD:Grapple">grapple</a>, success puts it back in the attackerâ€™s mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.
