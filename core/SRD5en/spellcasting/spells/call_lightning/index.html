<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="call-lightning">Call Lightning</h1>
<p><em>3rd-level conjuration</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes </p>
<p>A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see 100 feet directly above you. The spell fails if you can't see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can't accommodate the cloud).  <br/>
When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.  <br/>
If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d10. </p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd. </p></div>
