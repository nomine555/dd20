<p>To use this <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>, you must expend your psionic focus.
</p><p>You can empower a power. All variable, numeric effects of an empowered power are increased by one-half. An empowered power deals half again as much damage as normal, cures half again as many <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>, affects half again as many targets, and so forth, as appropriate. Augmented <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> can also be empowered (multiply 1-1/2 times the damage total of the augmented power). <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Saving throws</a> and opposed checks (such as the one you make when you manifest <i><a href="SRD_Dispel_Psionics.html" title="SRD:Dispel Psionics">dispel psionics</a></i>) are not affected, nor are <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> without random variables.
</p><p>Using this <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> increases the <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power point</a> cost of the power by 2. The powerâ€™s total cost cannot exceed your <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>.
