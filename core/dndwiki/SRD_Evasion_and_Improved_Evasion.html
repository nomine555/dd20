<p>These <a href="SRD_Extraordinary_Ability.html" title="SRD:Extraordinary Ability" class="mw-redirect">extraordinary abilities</a> allow the target of an area attack to leap or twist out of the way. <a href="SRD_Rogue.html" title="SRD:Rogue">Rogues</a> and <a href="SRD_Monk.html" title="SRD:Monk">monks</a> have evasion and improved evasion as <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> features, but certain other creatures have these abilities, too.
</p><p>If subjected to an attack that allows a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> save for half damage, a character with evasion takes no damage on a successful save. 
</p><p>As with a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> save for any creature, a character must have room to move in order to evade. A bound character or one squeezing through an area cannot use evasion.
</p><p>As with a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> save for any creature, evasion is a reflexive ability. The character need not know that the attack is coming to use evasion.
</p><p><a href="SRD_Rogue.html" title="SRD:Rogue">Rogues</a> and <a href="SRD_Monk.html" title="SRD:Monk">monks</a> cannot use evasion in medium or heavy armor. Some creatures with the evasion ability as an innate quality do not have this limitation.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Improved_Evasion">Improved Evasion</span></h4>
<p>Improved evasion is like evasion, except that even on a failed <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> the character takes only half damage.
