<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Attacks_of_Opportunity">Attacks of Opportunity</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes a combatant in a melee lets her guard down. In this case, combatants near her can take advantage of her lapse in defense to attack her for free. These free attacks are called attacks of opportunity.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Threatened_Squares">Threatened Squares</span></h5>
<p>You threaten all squares into which you can make a <a href="SRD_Melee_Attack.html" title="SRD:Melee Attack" class="mw-redirect">melee attack</a>, even when it is not your action. Generally, that means everything in all squares adjacent to your space (including diagonally). An enemy that takes certain actions while in a threatened square provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If you’re unarmed, you don’t normally threaten any squares and thus can’t make attacks of opportunity.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Reach_Weapons">Reach Weapons</span></h6>
<p>Most creatures of Medium or smaller size have a reach of only 5 feet. This means that they can make <a href="SRD_Melee_Attack.html" title="SRD:Melee Attack" class="mw-redirect">melee attacks</a> only against creatures up to 5 feet (1 square) away. However, Small and Medium creatures wielding <a href="SRD_Weapon_Categories.html#Reach_Weapons" title="SRD:Weapon Categories">reach weapons</a> threaten more squares than a typical creature. In addition, most creatures larger than Medium have a natural reach of 10 feet or more.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Provoking_an_Attack_of_Opportunity">Provoking an Attack of Opportunity</span></h5>
<p>Two kinds of actions can provoke attacks of opportunity: moving out of a threatened square and performing an action within a threatened square.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Moving">Moving</span></h6>
<p>Moving out of a threatened square usually provokes an attack of opportunity from the threatening opponent. There are two common methods of avoiding such an attack—the 5-foot-step and the <a href="SRD_Full-Round_Actions.html#Withdraw" title="SRD:Full-Round Actions">Withdraw</a> action (see <a href="SRD_Action_Types.html#Table:_Actions_in_Combat" title="SRD:Action Types">Table: Actions in Combat</a>).
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Performing_a_Distracting_Act">Performing a Distracting Act</span></h6>
<p>Some actions, when performed in a threatened square, provoke attacks of opportunity as you divert your attention from the battle. <a href="SRD_Action_Types.html#Table:_Actions_in_Combat" title="SRD:Action Types">Table: Actions in Combat</a> notes many of the actions that provoke attacks of opportunity.
</p><p>Remember that even actions that normally provoke attacks of opportunity may have exceptions to this rule.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Making_an_Attack_of_Opportunity">Making an Attack of Opportunity</span></h5>
<p>An attack of opportunity is a single <a href="SRD_Melee_Attack.html" title="SRD:Melee Attack" class="mw-redirect">melee attack</a>, and you can only make one per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. You don’t have to make an attack of opportunity if you don’t want to.
</p><p>An experienced character gets additional regular <a href="SRD_Melee_Attack.html" title="SRD:Melee Attack" class="mw-redirect">melee attacks</a> (by using the full attack action), but at a lower attack bonus. You make your attack of opportunity, however, at your normal attack bonus—even if you’ve already attacked in the <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>.
</p><p>An attack of opportunity “interrupts” the normal flow of actions in the <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. If an attack of opportunity is provoked, immediately resolve the attack of opportunity, then continue with the next character’s turn (or complete the current turn, if the attack of opportunity was provoked in the midst of a character’s turn).
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Combat_Reflexes_and_Additional_Attacks_of_Opportunity">Combat Reflexes and Additional Attacks of Opportunity</span></h6>
<p>If you have the <a href="SRD_Combat_Reflexes.html" title="SRD:Combat Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a> <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> you can add your <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dexterity</a> modifier to the number of attacks of opportunity you can make in a <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. This <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> does not let you make more than one attack for a given opportunity, but if the same opponent provokes two attacks of opportunity from you, you could make two separate attacks of opportunity (since each one represents a different opportunity). Moving out of more than one square threatened by the same opponent in the same <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> doesn’t count as more than one opportunity for that opponent. All these attacks are at your full normal attack bonus.
