<p><b>Shards:</b> These universal items are tiny fragments of cast-off crystal imprinted with minuscule bits of psionic power. Using a <i>shard </i>requires grasping it and projecting a command thought as a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> (most <i>shards </i>telepathically whisper their command word into the minds of living creatures who handle them). A <i>shard </i>grants a temporary competence bonus on <a href="SRD_Skills.html" title="SRD:Skills">one specific skill</a>, ranging from +1 to +10. The granted bonus lasts until the skill is used or 10 rounds pass, whichever comes first. Once its effect is activated, a <i>shard </i>disintegrates immediately, whether or not the bonus granted by the <i>shard </i>is eventually used.
