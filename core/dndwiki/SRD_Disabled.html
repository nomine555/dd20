<p>A character with 0 <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>, or one who has negative <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> but has become <a href="SRD_Stable.html" title="SRD:Stable">stable</a> and conscious, is disabled. A disabled character may take a single <a href="SRD_Move_Actions.html" title="SRD:Move Actions">move action</a> or <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> (but not both, nor can she take <a href="SRD_Full-Round_Actions.html" title="SRD:Full-Round Actions">full-round actions</a>). She moves at half speed. Taking <a href="SRD_Move_Actions.html" title="SRD:Move Actions">move actions</a> doesn’t risk further injury, but performing any <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> (or any other action the DM deems strenuous, including some <a href="SRD_Free_Actions.html" title="SRD:Free Actions">free actions</a> such as casting a quickened spell) deals 1 point of damage after the completion of the act. Unless the action increased the disabled character’s <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>, she is now in negative <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> and <a href="SRD_Dying.html" title="SRD:Dying">dying</a>.
</p><p>A disabled character with negative <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> recovers <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> naturally if she is being helped. Otherwise, each day she has a 10% chance to start recovering <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> naturally (starting with that day); otherwise, she loses 1 hit point. Once an unaided character starts recovering <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> naturally, she is no longer in danger of losing <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> (even if her current <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> are negative).
