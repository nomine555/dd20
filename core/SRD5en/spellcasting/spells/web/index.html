<p><em>2nd-level conjuration</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour </p>
<p>You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20- foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/combat/movement_and_position/index.html#difficult-terrain">Difficult Terrain</a> and lightly obscure their area.  <br/>
If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.  <br/>
Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a> as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.  <br/>
A creature <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a> by the webs can use its action to make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a>.  <br/>
The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire. </p></div>
