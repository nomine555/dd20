<p>You can create a <a href="SRD_Potions.html" title="SRD:Potions">potion</a> of any 3rd-level or lower spell that you know and that targets one or more creatures. Brewing a potion takes one day. When you create a potion, you set the <a href="SRD_Caster_Level.html" title="SRD:Caster Level" class="mw-redirect">caster level</a>, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a potion is its <a href="SRD_Spell_Level.html" title="SRD:Spell Level" class="mw-redirect">spell level</a> &#215; its <a href="SRD_Caster_Level.html" title="SRD:Caster Level" class="mw-redirect">caster level</a> &#215; 50 gp. To brew a potion, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one half this base price.
</p><p>When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell.
</p><p>Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the potion.
