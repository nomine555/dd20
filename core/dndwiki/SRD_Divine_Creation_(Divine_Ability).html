<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Divine rank 16, <a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Int</a> 29, <a href="SRD_Create_Object_(Divine_Ability).html" title="SRD:Create Object (Divine Ability)">Create Object</a> salient divine ability, <a href="SRD_Create_Greater_Object_(Divine_Ability).html" title="SRD:Create Greater Object (Divine Ability)">Create Greater Object</a> salient divine ability.
</p><p><b>Benefit:</b> As a <a href="SRD_Full-Round_Actions.html" title="SRD:Full-Round Actions">full-round action</a>, the deity can create mortal creatures or magic items whose total weight is up to 100 pounds per divine rank, or with a total volume of 20 cubic feet per rank. If the deity uses this ability on a divinely morphic plane or within its own godly realm, double the volume and weight the deity can create. If the deity’s realm is located on a divinely morphic plane, triple the volume and weight the deity can create there.
</p><p><b>Notes:</b> This ability works like the <a href="SRD_Create_Greater_Object_(Divine_Ability).html" title="SRD:Create Greater Object (Divine Ability)">Create Greater Object</a> ability, except as noted below.
</p><p>A deity can use this ability to create any kind of creature that does not have a divine rank. The deity can create a creature with <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">class levels</a>, but never with more <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">class levels</a> than the deity has itself or the deity’s divine rank, whichever is lower.
</p><p><b>Rest: </b>The deity must convert a considerable amount of its own energy into a creature, which always leaves the deity impaired. The deity must rest for 10 minutes &#215;the creature’s <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">Hit Dice</a> &#215;the creature’s Challenge Rating for each creature created, with a minimum of 10 minutes per creature. If the creature has <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">class levels</a>, each level counts as an additional <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">Hit Die</a>. 
</p><p>The deity can create any kind of magic item except an artifact.
</p><p>The rest requirement for creating magic items is the same as for the <a href="SRD_Create_Greater_Object_(Divine_Ability).html" title="SRD:Create Greater Object (Divine Ability)">Create Greater object</a> ability.
</p><p><b>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</b> Crafts, creation, supreme.
