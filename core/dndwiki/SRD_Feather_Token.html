<p><b>Feather Token:</b> Each of these items is a small feather that has a power to suit a special need. The kinds of tokens are described below. Each token is usable once.
</p><p><i>Anchor: </i>A token useful to moor a craft in water so as to render it immobile for up to one day.
</p><p><i>Bird: </i>A token that can be used to deliver a small written message unerringly to a designated target as would a carrier pigeon. The token lasts as long as it takes to carry the message.
</p><p><i>Fan: </i>A token that forms a huge flapping fan, causing a breeze of sufficient strength to propel one ship (about 25 mph). This wind is not cumulative with existing wind speed. The token can, however, be used to lessen existing winds, creating an area of relative calm or lighter winds (but wave size in a storm is not affected). The fan can be used for up to 8 hours. It does not function on land.
</p><p><i>Swan Boat: </i>A token that forms a swanlike boat capable of moving on water at a speed of 60 feet. It can carry eight horses and gear or thirty-two Medium characters or any equivalent combination. The boat lasts for one day.
</p><p><i>Tree: </i>A token that causes a great oak to spring into being (5-foot diameter trunk, 60-foot height, 40-foot top diameter). This is an instantaneous effect.
</p><p><i>Whip: </i>A token that forms into a huge leather <a href="SRD_Whip.html" title="SRD:Whip">whip</a> and wields itself against any opponent desired just like a dancing weapon. The weapon has a +10 <a href="SRD_Base_Attack_Bonus.html" title="SRD:Base Attack Bonus" class="mw-redirect">base attack bonus</a>, does 1d6+1 points of damage, has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and <a href="SRD_Attack_Damage.html" title="SRD:Attack Damage">damage rolls</a>, and a makes a free <a href="SRD_Grapple.html" title="SRD:Grapple">grapple</a> attack (with a +15 attack bonus) if it hits.
