<p>You can create any <a href="SRD_Staffs.html" title="SRD:Staffs">staff</a> whose prerequisites you meet.
</p><p>Crafting a staff takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a staff, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of its base price. A newly created staff has 50 charges.
</p><p>Some staffs incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the staff â€™s base price.
