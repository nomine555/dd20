<p><b>Darkskull: </b>This skull, carved from ebony, is wholly evil. Wherever the skull goes, the area around it is treated as though an <i><a href="../spellcasting/all-spells/h/hallow.html" title="SRD:Unhallow">unhallow</a> </i>spell had been cast with the skull as the touched point of origin (except that no additional spell effect is tied or fixed to the <i>darkskull</i>).
