<p><b>Efreeti Bottle: </b>This item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals. A thin stream of smoke is often seen issuing from it. The bottle can be opened once per day. When opened, the <a href="SRD_Efreeti.html" title="SRD:Efreeti">efreeti</a> imprisoned within issues from the bottle instantly. There is a 10% chance (01–10 on d%) that the efreeti is insane and attacks immediately upon being released. There is also a 10% chance (91–100) that the efreeti of the bottle grants three <i><a href="SRD_Wish.html" title="SRD:Wish">wishes</a></i>. In either case, the efreeti afterward disappears forever. The other 80% of the time (11–90), the inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the character for up to 10 minutes per day (or until the efreeti’s death), doing as she commands. Roll each day the bottle is opened for that day’s effect.
