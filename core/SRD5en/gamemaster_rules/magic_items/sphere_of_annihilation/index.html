<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em> </p>
<p>This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.  <br/>
The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a <strong>sphere of annihilation</strong>, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.  <br/>
The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/intelligence/index.html">Intelligence</a> (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 Ã— your <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/intelligence/index.html">Intelligence</a> modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.  <br/>
If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature's control, you make an <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/intelligence/index.html">Intelligence</a> (Arcana) check contested by the other creature's <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/intelligence/index.html">Intelligence</a> (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.  <br/>
If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/gate/index.html">Gate</a></em></strong> spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a <strong>portable hole</strong>, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table. </p>
