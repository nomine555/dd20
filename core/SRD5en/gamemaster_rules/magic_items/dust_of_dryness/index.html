<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em> </p>
<p>This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible.  <br/>
Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet's magic.  <br/>
An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. </p></div>
