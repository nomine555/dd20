<p><em>6th-level evocation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Self (60-foot line)  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a magnifying glass)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute </p>
<p>A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Blinded</a> until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Blinded</a> by this spell. Undead and oozes have <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> on this saving throw.  <br/>
You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.  <br/>
For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight. </p></div>
