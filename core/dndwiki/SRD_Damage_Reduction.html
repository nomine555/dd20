<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Damage_Reduction_.28Ex_or_Su.29">Damage Reduction (<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ex" title="SRD:Ex" class="mw-redirect">Ex</a> or <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Su" title="SRD:Su" class="mw-redirect">Su</a>)</span></h3>
<p>A creature with this special quality ignores damage from most weapons and natural attacks. Wounds heal immediately, or the weapon bounces off harmlessly (in either case, the opponent knows the attack was ineffective). The creature takes normal damage from energy attacks (even nonmagical ones), spells, <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like abilities</a>, and <a href="SRD_Supernatural_Ability.html" title="SRD:Supernatural Ability" class="mw-redirect">supernatural abilities</a>. A certain kind of weapon can sometimes damage the creature normally, as noted below.
</p><p>The entry indicates the amount of damage ignored (usually 5 to 15 points) and the type of weapon that negates the ability. 
</p><p>Some monsters are vulnerable to piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing damage <span class="errata">(<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ex" title="SRD:Ex" class="mw-redirect">Ex</a>)</span>.
</p><p>Some monsters are vulnerable to certain materials, such as alchemical silver <span class="errata">(<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Su" title="SRD:Su" class="mw-redirect">Su</a>)</span>, adamantine <span class="errata">(<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ex" title="SRD:Ex" class="mw-redirect">Ex</a>)</span>, or cold-forged iron <span class="errata">(<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Su" title="SRD:Su" class="mw-redirect">Su</a>)</span>. Attacks from weapons that are not made of the correct material have their damage reduced, even if the weapon has an enhancement bonus.
</p><p>Some monsters are vulnerable to magic weapons <span class="errata">(<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Su" title="SRD:Su" class="mw-redirect">Su</a>)</span>. Any weapon with at least a +1 magical enhancement bonus on attack and <a href="SRD_Attack_Damage.html" title="SRD:Attack Damage">damage rolls</a> overcomes the damage reduction of these monsters. Such creatures’ <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Natural_Weapon" title="SRD:Natural Weapon" class="mw-redirect">natural weapons</a> (but not their attacks with weapons) are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
</p><p>A few very powerful monsters are vulnerable only to epic weapons; that is, magic weapons with at least a +6 enhancement bonus. Such creatures’ <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Natural_Weapon" title="SRD:Natural Weapon" class="mw-redirect">natural weapons</a> are also treated as epic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
</p><p>Some monsters are vulnerable to chaotic-, evil-, good-, or lawful-aligned weapons <span class="errata">(<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Su" title="SRD:Su" class="mw-redirect">Su</a>)</span>. When a <a href="SRD_Cleric.html" title="SRD:Cleric">cleric</a> casts <a href="SRD_Align_Weapon.html" title="SRD:Align Weapon"><i>align weapon</i></a>, affected weapons might gain one or more of these properties, and certain magic weapons have these properties as well. A creature with an alignment subtype (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) can overcome this type of damage reduction with its <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Natural_Weapon" title="SRD:Natural Weapon" class="mw-redirect">natural weapons</a> and weapons it wields as if the weapons or <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Natural_Weapon" title="SRD:Natural Weapon" class="mw-redirect">natural weapons</a> had an alignment (or alignments) that match the subtype(s) of the creature. Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon (in addition to any alignment it may already have).
</p><p>When a damage reduction entry has a dash (–) after the slash, no weapon negates the damage reduction <span class="errata">(<a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ex" title="SRD:Ex" class="mw-redirect">Ex</a>)</span>.
</p><p>A few creatures are harmed by more than one kind of weapon. A weapon of either type overcomes this damage reduction.
</p><p>A few other creatures require combinations of different types of attacks to overcome their damage reduction. A weapon must be both types to overcome this damage reduction. A weapon that is only one type is still subject to damage reduction.
</p><p>Whenever damage reduction completely negates the damage from an attack, it also negates most special effects that accompany the attack, such as injury type poison, a <a href="SRD_Monk.html" title="SRD:Monk">monk</a>’s stunning, and injury type disease. Damage reduction does not negate <a href="SRD_Touch_Attack.html" title="SRD:Touch Attack" class="mw-redirect">touch attacks</a>, energy damage dealt along with an attack, or energy drains. Nor does it affect poisons or diseases delivered by inhalation, ingestion, or contact.
</p><p>Attacks that deal no damage because of the target’s damage reduction do not disrupt spells.
</p><p>If a creature has damage reduction from more than one source, the two forms of damage reduction do not stack. Instead, the creature gets the benefit of the best damage reduction in a given situation.
