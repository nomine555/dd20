<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="wall-of-force">Wall of Force</h1>
<p><em>5th-level evocation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes </p>
<p>An <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Invisible</a> wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).  <br/>
Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/dispel_magic/index.html">Dispel Magic</a></em></strong>. A <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/disintegrate/index.html">Disintegrate</a></em></strong> spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall. </p></div>
