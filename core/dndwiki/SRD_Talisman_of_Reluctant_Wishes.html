<p><b>Talisman of Reluctant Wishes: </b>A talisman of this sort appears the same as a <i><a href="SRD_Stone_of_Controlling_Earth_Elementals.html" title="SRD:Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals">stone of controlling earth elementals</a>. </i>Its <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> are quite different, however, and dependent on the <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a> of the individual holding the talisman. Whenever a character touches a <i>talisman of reluctant wishes, </i>he must make a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Charisma_Check" title="SRD:Charisma Check" class="mw-redirect">Charisma check</a>. 
</p><p>If he fails, the device acts as a <i><a href="SRD_Stone_of_Weight.html" title="SRD:Stone of Weight">stone of weight</a></i>. Discarding or destroying it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman. 
</p><p>If he succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a <i><a href="SRD_Wish.html" title="SRD:Wish">wish</a> </i>is made with it, whichever comes first. It then disappears.
</p><p>If he rolls a natural 20, the character finds it impossible to be rid of the talisman for as many months as he has points of <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a>. In addition, the artifact grants him one <i>wish </i>for every 6 points of the characterâ€™s <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a>. It also grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.)
</p><p>Regardless of which reaction results, a <i>talisman of reluctant wishes </i>disappears when its time period expires, leaving behind a 10,000 gp diamond in its stead.
