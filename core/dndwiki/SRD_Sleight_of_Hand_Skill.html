<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sleight_of_Hand_.28Dex.3B_Trained_Only.3B_Armor_Check_Penalty.29">Sleight of Hand (<a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dex</a>; Trained Only; <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Armor_Check_Penalty" title="SRD:Armor Check Penalty" class="mw-redirect">Armor Check Penalty</a>)</span></h3>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Check">Check</span></h5>
<p>A <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 10 Sleight of Hand check lets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a minor <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> of legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> of 10 unless an observer is determined to note where the item went.
</p><p>When you use this skill under close observation, your <a href="SRD_Skill_Check.html" title="SRD:Skill Check" class="mw-redirect">skill check</a> is opposed by the observer’s <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html" title="SRD:Spot Skill">Spot check</a>. The observer’s success doesn’t prevent you from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed.
</p><p>You can hide a small object (including a <a href="SRD_Light_Weapon.html" title="SRD:Light Weapon">light weapon</a> or an easily concealed <a href="SRD_Ranged_Weapon.html" title="SRD:Ranged Weapon">ranged weapon</a>, such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow) on your body. Your Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html" title="SRD:Spot Skill">Spot check</a> of anyone observing you or the <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html" title="SRD:Search Skill">Search check</a> of anyone frisking you. In the latter case, the searcher gains a +4 bonus on the Search check, since it’s generally easier to find such an object than to hide it. A <a href="SRD_Dagger.html" title="SRD:Dagger">dagger</a> is easier to hide than most light weapons, and grants you a +2 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it. An extraordinarily small object, such as a coin, shuriken, or ring, grants you a +4 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it, and heavy or baggy clothing (such as a cloak) grants you a +2 bonus on the check.
</p><p>Drawing a hidden weapon is a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> and doesn’t provoke an <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attack of opportunity</a>.
</p><p>If you try to take something from another creature, you must make a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 20 Sleight of Hand check to obtain it. The opponent makes a <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html" title="SRD:Spot Skill">Spot</a> check to detect the attempt, opposed by the same Sleight of Hand check result you achieved when you tried to grab the item. An opponent who succeeds on this check notices the attempt, regardless of whether you got the item.
</p><p>You can also use Sleight of Hand to entertain an audience as though you were using the Perform skill. In such a case, your “act” encompasses elements of legerdemain, juggling, and the like.

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Epic_Check">Epic Check</span></h5>
<p>You can lift another’s weapon and perform major <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a> of legerdemain.  (See table.)
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Action">Action</span></h5>
<p>Any Sleight of Hand check normally is a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>. However, you may perform a Sleight of Hand check as a <a href="SRD_Free_Actions.html" title="SRD:Free Actions">free action</a> by taking a –20 penalty on the check.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Try_Again">Try Again</span></h5>
<p>Yes, but after an initial failure, a second Sleight of Hand attempt against the same target (or while you are being watched by the same observer who noticed your previous attempt) increases the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> for the task by 10.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Special">Special</span></h5>
<p>If you have the <a href="SRD_Deft_Hands.html" title="SRD:Deft Hands">Deft Hands</a> <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>, you get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Synergy">Synergy</span></h5>
<p>If you have 5 or more ranks in <a href="SRD_Bluff_Skill.html" title="SRD:Bluff Skill">Bluff</a>, you get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Untrained">Untrained</span></h5>
<p>An untrained Sleight of Hand check is simply a <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Dexterity_Check" title="SRD:Dexterity Check" class="mw-redirect">Dexterity check</a>. Without actual training, you can’t succeed on any Sleight of Hand check with a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> higher than 10, except for hiding an object on your body.
