<p><b>Stone Horse:</b> Each item of this nature appears to be a fullsized, roughly hewn statue of a horse, carved from some type of hard stone. A command word brings the steed to life, enabling it to carry a burden and even to attack as if it were a real horse of the appropriate kind.
</p><p>A <i>stone horse </i>can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never needs to rest or feed. Damage dealt to it can be repaired by first using a <i><a href="SRD_Stone_to_Flesh.html" title="SRD:Stone to Flesh">stone to flesh</a> </i>spell, thus causing the <i>stone horse </i>to become a normal horse that can be healed normally. When fully healed, it automatically reverts to its stone form. While in its stone form, it can be fed gems, healing 1 point of damage for each 50 gp worth of mineral it is given.
</p><p>There are two sorts of <i>stone horses.</i>
</p><p><i>Courser: </i>This item has the statistics of a <a href="SRD_Horse.html" title="SRD:Horse">heavy horse</a> as well as having hardness 10.
</p><p><i>Destrier: </i>This item has the statistics of a <a href="SRD_Horse.html" title="SRD:Horse">heavy warhorse</a> as well as having hardness 10.
