# INTRODUCTION
This tutorial will guide you through the steps necessary to create your own adventure for the *GameThrough* system of Digital d20 Adventures.  

*GameThrough* uses Twine to create adventures with linked elements and also provides you with interactive maps, music and the SRD5 content library.

To create an adventure you just have to write it with the right format and observe the results, like this:

![large](https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ejemplo-markdown.jpg)

With all this, we will generate an adventure that we can load in Digital d20. 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitald20.com/play/custom-adventure/fan-adventure.html&quot; download&gt;Download the example adventure&lt;/a&gt; and open it with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twinery.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Twine&lt;/a&gt;.

## Twine
Before you start, you&#39;ll need the free Twine tool. Using Twine is very simple, and does not require any previous knowledge or programming skills. Download Twine &lt;a href=&quot;https://twinery.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or use its online version. Twine organizes the scenes in cards called &quot;Passages&quot; that you can edit and reorder.
Visit the [[Twine]] section for more information. 

&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flow-en.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;![large](https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flow-en.jpg)&lt;/a&gt;  

## Markdown
Markdown is a coding system that allows you to write rich text using plain text. You don&#39;t have to download anything to write with Markdown, since Markdown is *a way of writing*. It is very simple, we give you all the keys in the *Markdown* section.


## GameTrough system
The *GameTrough* system of the Digital d20 uses Markdown. Based on Markdown and own constructions, the *GameTrough* system can interpret the code for:  

* Generate maps to navigate between different locations.
* Incorporate the complete SRD5 and hyperlink all the keywords.
* Show information about spells, magic objects and monsters wherever they appear.
* Include music.
* Show a flow chart with the development of the adventure that leads to each encounter.

Creating an adventure using the *GameTrough* system is as simple as creating the scenes in *Twine Passages* and then uploading it to Digital d20. You will find more information about Twine in the section *Twine*.

## Load an adventure
Once you have the adventure ready, you can load the HTML file created by Twine in the upper area of this page.

Remember that uploading this file will upload the new adventure. To return to the tutorial you must press *Clear*.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Indice" tags="@index-main" position="75,281" size="100,100">

# PASSAGES
A passage is an element in Twine. It&#39;s the way Twine organizes the scenes of a story. The *GameThrough* system uses the passages to create three types of scenes:  
* **Index scenes:** Which keep the index on the left side, with information only on the right side.
* *Encounters*: Scenes that incorporate music, images and/or maps and additional information on the left side.
* **Places:** Navigable maps with pop-up descriptions.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ejemplo-pasaje-en.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;![large](https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ejemplo-pasaje-en.jpg)&lt;/a&gt;   

The passages are made up of:

| Content | Description |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Title | The **Title** is the name of the passage, by which it will be referenced wherever it appears.   |
| Tags | The **Tags** are located between the title and the text and provide additional functionality, as we&#39;ll see below. |
| Text | The **Text** is the content of the passage itself.  	 |


By pressing the lower button **+Passage** in Twine, a passage is created.  

## Ticket labels
Once inside a passage, clicking on **+Label** allows us to add different behaviors to each passage, depending on:

| Content | Description |
|:----:|:-------------|
| &lt;div class=&quot;codigo&quot;&gt;flow&lt;/div&gt; | Makes the passage visible in the *Flowchart*. This does not affect other behaviors.   |
| &lt;div class=&quot;codigo&quot;&gt;encounter&lt;/div&gt; | The passage is an encounter, with one or more images, music and maps. It also has a section called &quot;At a Glance&quot; and &quot;Conclusion&quot;. For more details see section *Encounters*. |
| &lt;div class=&quot;codigo&quot;&gt;@main-map&lt;/div&gt; | Of all the maps (see section [[Maps]]) one of them has to be the initial one, the first one you see when you click on the appropriate section. That passage has to be labeled **@main-map**. |
| &lt;div class=&quot;codigo&quot;&gt;@monsters&lt;/div&gt; | The stats of the monsters of the adventure will all be in this passage. |
| &lt;div class=&quot;codigo&quot;&gt;@index-main&lt;/div&gt; | For the adventure index. The rest of the passages will be linked from here. |
| &lt;div class=&quot;codigo&quot;&gt;@summary&lt;/div&gt; | The first content that shows the adventure will be the summary. This passage usually has no images (it&#39;s not an encounter). |
| &lt;div class=&quot;codigo&quot;&gt;@npcs&lt;/div&gt; | Passage that picks up the NPCs of the adventure. |
| &lt;div class=&quot;codigo&quot;&gt;@notes&lt;/div&gt; | The notes on the side of the adventure will all be in this passage. |
 
## Meetings
The meetings are a special kind of passage that includes a left zone with images, music, maps and additional information. You can learn more about this in the *Encounters* section.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Links" tags="" position="644,160" size="100,100">
# LINKS
## Links to SRD5 released content
The *GameThrough* system automatically generates links for the desired keywords (and are part of the SRD5).

This way you can generate links for:
* Spells
* Monsters
* Rules
* Magic objects  

existing in the SRD5, which will be automatically generated to appear in the left information area. 

&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/notas-al-margen-en.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;![ancho50](https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/notas-al-margen-en.jpg)&lt;/a&gt;

To do this, you must write the text *between asterisks*. The system will detect the content of the highlighted text, and will create a hyperlink with the corresponding entry to display a *magical object*, *trap*, etc.

Here you can see all the SRD5 material you can link to:  
[[Linked SRD5 content]].

## Links to own content
You can also use this system to automatically create hyperlinks to content specific to the adventure. 

In this way, links can be generated to:
* **Monsters:** They will always be shown in the left zone of a meeting, with a cross to close them once they have been consulted.  
* **NPC&#39;s:** They have their own section, although they can also be shown in the left section, if an entry is created with their name.  
* **Passage:** A link to a passage (created by putting the name of the passage between asterisks) will take the user to that passage.  
* **Margin notes:** Margin notes will always be displayed in a floating window.  
* Maps:** Within a map the links can be of two types:  
 * **Links between maps** (green text) navigate between the different maps of the adventure.
 * **Points of interest** (circles you see) provide additional information of a specific area of a map.

To do this, in addition to writing the text between asterisks, there must be the corresponding entry as a first level title in the passages **@monsters**, **@notes** and **@main-npcs**. The system will detect the content of the highlighted text, and create a hyperlink to the corresponding section.  

The **Monsters** are displayed in the left information area.  
NPCs have their own section, but can also be displayed in the left information area by creating a link with their name.  
The **Notes in the margin** are shown in a floating window.  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Media content" tags="" position="772,161" size="100,100">
# MEDIA CONTENT
There are five types of multimedia content that can be added to the adventures. 

* Pictures and audios can be placed anywhere in any type of entry.  
* Music and maps are only supported in the Gathering type tickets.

## Audio
The audio files will appear at the beginning of the passage with a mini player. They have to be entered **before** any other content in the passage, with the following format

&lt;div class=&quot;codigo cuadro&quot;&gt;\!\[audio](www.routeoftheaudio.mp3)&lt;/div&gt;

## Pictures in meetings
**In the passages of type encounter ** the text will be accompanied by between one and four images. These will appear in the left area of the meeting and, when you click on each one of them, you will see it in a floating window, full screen. You have to enter **before** any other content in the passage, with the following format

&lt;div class=&quot;cuadro codigo&quot;&gt;\!\[image](www.routeoftheimage.jpg)&lt;/div&gt;

Any type of file is supported.  

## Embedded images  
In any type of passage, images can be inserted in any part of the passage. There are three formats to do this, depending on the size you want to display:

&lt;div class=&quot;codigo cuadro&quot;&gt;
\[small](www.routeoftheimage.jpg)
&lt;br/&gt;
\[medium](www.routeoftheimage.jpg)
&lt;br/&gt;
\[large](www.routeoftheimage.jpg)
&lt;/div&gt;   

Jpg and png files are supported.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Monsters" tags="" position="523,285" size="100,100">
# MONSTERS
The monsters are linked like the rest of the contents, putting the name of the monster between asterisks. If the monster is part of the SRD5, the rule monster will be displayed. If it is a monster created for the adventure, the link is created in the same way, but the monster must be included in the passage @monsters with a specific format. When you click on a monster&#39;s link, it will be displayed in the left information area. 

Here is an example monster. You can click on the image to see it bigger or, if you have doubts, check the code after the image.  

&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ejemplo-monstruo-en.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;![large](https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ejemplo-monstruo-en.jpg)&lt;/a&gt;

In the example adventure &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitald20.com/play/custom-adventure/fan-adventure.html&quot; download&gt;Kidnap at Brookmili&lt;/a&gt; you have example monsters so you can use their format.

Also, in the following file you have all the content of the SRD (including the monsters) in case you want to use one&#39;s format as a basis to create your own:  

&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mardkdown-srd5.txt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;SRD5 Monster Library&lt;/a&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Maps" tags="" position="884,166" size="100,100">
# MAPS
Both navigation maps and those included in the encounter-type passages are generated in the same way. A map-type passage can be included in either section.  

&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ejemplo-mapa-en.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;![large](https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ejemplo-mapa-en.jpg)&lt;/a&gt;


## Structure
The beginning of the passage, the image of the map must be included:  

&lt;div class=&quot;codigo cuadro&quot;&gt;\!\[map](www.rutadelaimagen.jpg)&lt;/div&gt;

This will simply display the map in the corresponding section (remember that the first map must always have the label **@main-map**). In addition, two types of links can be added:

### Link to another map
To link from one map to another you only need to place a marker on the map, with the following format:  

&lt;div class=&quot;codigo cuadro&quot;&gt;\# @xxxxxx &lt;\!\-\-20,10--&gt;&gt;/div&gt;  

Where @xxxxxx is the name tag of the target map, and the two numbers are the position of the pointer. The label will show the name of the target map.  

### Link to info window
To display an information window on a map, a bookmark must be placed with the following format:

&lt;div class=&quot;codigo cuadro&quot;&gt;\# Name &lt;\-\-10,10--&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Text to be displayed in the floating window. A link to a passage can also be included here.&lt;/div&gt;

Where the name is the title to be displayed and the number pair is the position of the label. The text will be displayed after the title.

## Tag Positioner
The X, Y points that follow the map titles are the relative position in percentage on the background image. You have the following tool at your disposal to easily calculate them:  
[[Label pleasure]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="NPCs" tags="" position="763,288" size="100,100">
# NPC&#39;s
Non-playing characters must be grouped together in a passage labeled **@main-npcs**. Otherwise, it is not very different from a normal passage. Although they have their own section, NPCs can also be displayed on the left side of a passage.  

Each NPC will consist of:  

* **First level title:** This will be the name of the character, which will be referenced wherever it is written between asterisks.  
* **Inlaid image (optional)** Using the format indicated in [[Media content]] you can include one or several images, in any size.  
* Descriptive text:** The text that will go under the title with the name of the character. You can include any reference to rules, other characters, spells, encounters, etc.
* **Character card (optional)** The character card with the format indicated in the *Monsters* section.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/pnjs.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;![large](https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/pnjs.jpg)&lt;/a&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Flowchart" tags="" position="883,288" size="100,100">
# FLOWCHART
For the flowchart of an adventure it is not necessary to create specific passages, you only have to add the tag **flow** to each passage you want to be shown in the diagram.  

To link passages in Twine you have to create relationships between them using **\[Passage name]. This way, the relationship arrows will appear in the Twine diagram.  

Moving the passages we will create from Twine the flowchart that will be shown in the adventure, with the same arrangement of elements

&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flow-en.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;![large](https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flow-en.jpg)&lt;/a&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Markdown" tags="" position="240,402" size="100,100">
# MARKDOWN
Markdown is a coding system that allows you to write rich text using plain text. The own codings are very simple:

&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tabla-markdown-en.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;
![large](https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tabla-markdown-en.jpg)&lt;/a&gt;

## Separation between lines
* The carriage return (ENTER key) by itself has no effect.  
* Two spaces are used at the end of a line to create a new line. After this, adding a carriage return (ENTER key) will make the space larger.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lineas-en.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;![large](https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lineas-en.jpg)&lt;/a&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Encounters" tags="" position="377,288" size="100,100">
# ENCOUNTERS
The meetings are a special type of passage that includes a left zone with images, music and two sections: **At a Glance** and **Conclusion**, as shown in the picture:

&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/encuentro-en.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;![large](https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/encuentro-en.jpg)&lt;/a&gt;

As we can see, the structure of an encounter-type passage has three parts:

## Content
The general structure of the passage is the same as any other in terms of levels of titles, links and so on.   

 
## Multimedia content within meetings
Within an encounter there is specific multimedia content that is shown in a special way in the encounter-type passages. The introduction codes must be written at the beginning of the passage for encounter images, music, maps and audio, before any other content.

* The music, maps and images located **before** the title of the meeting behave differently from the multimedia content in the rest of the passages: they will appear in the left area of the meeting. Only one music track and up to four images/maps can be included.  
* The images and audios **after** the first title in the encounters behave the same as in any other type of Passage. Thus, any number of pictures can be included, but only one audio.  

An example of this can be seen in the image at the beginning of this entry.

## Music
**In the encounter-type passages**, music is included that can set the scene. It has to be introduced **before** any other content in the passage, with the following format

&lt;div class=&quot;codigo cuadro&quot;&gt;\!\[music](www.routetothemusic.mp3)&lt;/div&gt;

The music will appear in the left zone, in an on/off button.

## Maps
**In the encounter type passages, one or more maps can be included in the same area as the images, which may have relevant information hyperlinked (see [[Maps]]). Clicking on the map will open it in a floating window.  

The code has to be entered **before** any other content in the passage, with the following format

&lt;div class=&quot;codigo cuadro&quot;&gt;\!\[map](@xxxxx)&lt;/div&gt;

Where **@xxxxx** is the name of the tag that has the map we link.  

The maps appear in the left zone, together with the images.

## At a Glance and Conclusion
This area shows what the characters will see at the meeting. The most common spells and incantations are usually included, such as *Perception*, *Investigation* or *Detect Magic*.  
&lt;div class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codigo&quot;&gt;AT A GLANCE&lt;br/&gt;
---&lt;/div&gt;
Text to be displayed in the **At a Glance** area.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

The &quot;Conclusion&quot; section is reserved for notes that indicate the links to the next match or what the players need to have seen or done before moving on to the next one.  
It is also a short summary so that the DM can &quot;browse&quot; the adventure quickly.

&lt;div class=&quot;table&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codigo&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br/&gt;
---&lt;/div&gt;
Text to be displayed in the **Conclusion** area.
&lt;/div&gt;

# ONLINE FILE HOSTING
For the inclusion of multimedia files, it is necessary to upload them somewhere online. Here are some options on where to do it:

## Dropbox
Dropbox is one of the most famous online tools

### Step 1: Create Dropbox account and sign in
First we went to the Dropbox website and created a new account. Dropbox asks for our first and last names, an email and a password. Once the account is created we will have 2gb of free cloud hosting.

We can link Dropbox with our Smartphone by downloading the application in the AppStore (iPhone) or Play Store (Android), or we can download the PC/MacOsX version. It is not necessary to have our account linked to our phone or computer, but we will improve productivity and can use it more easily.

### Step 2: Upload files to Dropbox
The process of uploading files to Dropbox to use it as an image server is very easy. If we have Dropbox open in the browser we just have to grab and drag the desired files from our computer to the Dropbox window and drop them. We can also click on the icon of the sheet of paper with a plus to be able to add one or more files.

If we have installed Dropbox on our PC or MacOSx it will have created a folder called Dropbox on the desktop or in My Documents where we can drag the files to upload them.

We can create folders to keep our files organized.

### Step 3: How to get the link to the file on the server
If we go to Dropbox.com, click on the file we want to use and go to Share we&#39;ll see that it offers &quot;create a link&quot;. That URL will take us to the file we&#39;ve uploaded but not to the URL of the server folder where it&#39;s hosted. If we use this first URL in an HTML file as the source (source or src in HTML) for an image tag we won&#39;t be able to see the file as we need to have the address of the server folder where it&#39;s hosted.

Dropbox doesn&#39;t give us that URL, it just gives us a URL that takes us to the gallery and opens that image:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/oo4yazg7rwiug3x/dropbox-image.jpg.

The URL takes us to the image, but if we use it as src of an image it won&#39;t work for us. Why? Because using Dropbox as an image host gives us the URL to a gallery, not to the native image file.

There is a way to modify the URL and be able to point directly to the file hosted in the server. To do this, we only have to change https://www.dropbox.com/ to https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/.

Our new URL would be: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/oo4yazg7rwiug3x/dropbox-image.jpg.

This URL points directly to the image, with no more HTML code, so we can use it in our email signatures or websites without fear of them expiring and being deleted.

## Random Dungeon Generator
Random Dungeon Generator is a highly configurable random dungeon generator that has been around since 1999 and gives very good results. If you are short of time, Random Dungeon Generator is your ally with dungeons. You can leave it free or set some parameters and let it work its magic.

You can start using Random Dungeon Generator here.

## Random Dungeon Map Creator
In the same spirit as the previous one, Random Dungeon Map Creator creates random maps with a default setting, except that it doesn&#39;t create the content of the dungeons, that will have to be done by the DM.

You can start using Random Dungeon Map Creator &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gozzys.com/dungeon-maps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Additional tools" tags="" position="1121,293" size="100,100">
# EDITING TOOLS
Here is information on some free editing tools that can be useful in creating designs and maps.

## GIMP
GIMP is an open source image editing application that, unlike its major competitor, is also available for Linux as well as Windows or MacOS. All the files required for installation can be found on the official project page. This open source photo editor is extended by means of extensions, which, added to the advantages that free software brings in terms of collaborative development, has generated, over the years, a constantly growing range of functions.  

Download GIMP &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gimp.org.es/modules/mydownloads/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

## Paint.NET
Paint.NET, the freeware developed by students, once open source, is now sponsored by Microsoft, which determines its incompatibility with Linux and macOS and the need for a Windows operating system at least in the seventh version to use it.  

Download Paint.NET &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getpaint.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

## Pixlr
Pixlr facilitates image transformation with a very complete editor. Whether you&#39;re applying a quick fix to your photos or adding effects, overlays or borders, Pixlr has everything you need to do it. Plus, Pixlr is easy and free.  

Download Pixlr &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixlr.com/x/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

## Photoscape
Another digital image editing and management tool is Photoscape, along with GIMP one of the most widespread free alternatives to Photoshop and very popular especially among amateur photographers. Because of its ease of use and its robust and extensive functionality for both the private and semi-professional user, this is a very satisfying software. Photoscape offers a lot of basic retouching functions as cutting, applying effects, adding objects or correcting clarity, contrast and colour, but it is also possible to work on several photos at once in order to, for example, cut, name and correct them.

# HOMEBREWERY

&lt;a href=&quot;https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Homebrewery&lt;/a&gt; is a tool for formatting adventures. Using markdown, you can import any text and give it the look of an official adventure of the wizards of the coast. It is a Scott Tolksdorf&#39;s project that develops in solitaire by means of which a concrete format is applied to the titles, information boxes, monsters, etc, in the same way that the system *GameThrough* does.  

Therefore, once you have the adventure ready for *GameThrough* you only have to import it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Homebrewery&lt;/a&gt; to obtain a perfectly formatted pdf file.  

&lt;a href=&quot;https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/HJWLQsTwUZ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; you have a Homebrewery Formatting Guide to use.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="pasaje2" tags="" position="540,405" size="100,100">

# LABEL PLACER
To calculate the position of the labels on the maps we have developed a small tool that calculates those X, Y numbers for you. Access it by clicking on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitald20.com/play/map-creator/map_creator.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;

## 1: Load the map
First you must load the map into the top box of the tool. Use any method from the [[Hosting files online]] section or try this one we have loaded ourselves:  

https://digitald20.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/region.jpg

## 2: Putting the dots
Once loaded, by clicking on the image, numbered balls will appear at the points where you want to provide relevant information.

## 3: Get the position of the points
The &#39;Show Text&#39; button will show the position of all the points placed, in order, so you can incorporate it into the GameTrough tool in the twine.
