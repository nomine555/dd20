<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em> </p>
<p>While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command word. This turns the cloak into a pair of <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/bat/index.html">Bat</a> wings or bird wings on your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you can't use them again for 1d12 hours.</p></div>
