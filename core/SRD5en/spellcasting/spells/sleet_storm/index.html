<p><em>3rd-level conjuration</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute </p>
<p>Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.  <br/>
The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/combat/movement_and_position/index.html#difficult-terrain">Difficult Terrain</a>. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw. On a failed save, it falls <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Prone</a>.  <br/>
If a creature is concentrating in the spell's area, the creature must make a successful <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration. </p></div>
