<p><em>Wand, uncommon</em> </p>
<p>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/magic_missile/index.html">Magic Missile</a></em></strong> spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.  <br/>
The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.</p></div>
