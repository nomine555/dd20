<strong>Challenge</strong> 2 (450 XP) </p>
<p><strong>Ooze Cube.</strong> The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's Engulf and has <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> on the saving throw.  <br/>
Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/combat/cover/index.html">Cover</a>.  <br/>
A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful DC 12 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> check, and the creature making the attempt takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.  <br/>
The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.  <br/>
<strong>Transparent.</strong> Even when the cube is in plain sight, it takes a successful DC 15 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> (Perception) check to spot a cube that has neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter the cube's space while unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube. </p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong>Pseudopod.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (3d6) acid damage.  <br/>
<strong>Engulf.</strong> The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the cube enters a creature's space, the creature must make a DC 12 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw.  <br/>
On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the cube. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.  <br/>
On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Restrained</a>, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the cube's turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.  <br/>
An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.</p></div>
