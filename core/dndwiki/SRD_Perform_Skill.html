<p>The attitude of fanatic is added here. In addition to the obvious effects, any NPC whose attitude is fanatic gains a +2 morale bonus to <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a> and <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a> scores, a +1 morale bonus on <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Will</a> saves, and a –1 penalty to <a href="SRD_AC.html" title="SRD:AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a> whenever fighting for you or your cause. This attitude will remain for one day plus one day per point of your <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a> bonus, at which point the NPC’s attitude will revert to its original attitude (or indifferent, if no attitude is specified).
</p><p>Treat the fanatic attitude as a mind-affecting enchantment effect for purposes of immunity, save bonuses, or being detected by the <a href="SRD_Sense_Motive_Skill.html" title="SRD:Sense Motive Skill">Sense Motive</a> skill. Since it is nonmagical, it can’t be dispelled; however, any effect that suppresses or counters mind-affecting effects will affect it normally. A fanatic NPC’s attitude can’t be further adjusted by the use of skills.

<p>Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in public requires anywhere from an evening’s work to a full day’s performance. The <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard’s</a> special Perform-based abilities are described in that <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a>’s description.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Try_Again">Try Again</span></h5>
<p>Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don’t negate previous failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed in the past is likely to be prejudiced against future performances. (Increase the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> by 2 for each previous failure.)
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Special">Special</span></h5>
<p>A <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a> must have at least 3 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire courage in his allies, or to use his countersong or his <i><a href="SRD_Fascinated.html" title="SRD:Fascinated">fascinate</a> </i>ability. A <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a> needs 6 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire competence, 9 ranks to use his <i>suggestion </i>ability, 12 ranks to inspire greatness, 15 ranks to use his <i>song of freedom </i>ability, 18 ranks to inspire heroics, and 21 ranks to use his <i>mass suggestion </i>ability. See <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">Bardic</a> Music in the <a href="SRD_Bard.html" title="SRD:Bard">bard</a> <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> description.
</p><p>In addition to using the Perform skill, you can entertain people with sleight of hand, tumbling, tightrope walking, and spells (especially illusions).
