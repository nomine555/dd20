<p><em>1st-level abjuration</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration up to 10 minutes </p>
<p>Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.  <br/>
The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a>, <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Frightened</a>, or possessed by them. If the target is already <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a>, <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Frightened</a>, or possessed by such a creature, the target has <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a> on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.</p></div>
