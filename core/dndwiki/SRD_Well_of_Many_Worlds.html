<p><b>Well of Many Worlds:</b> This strange, interdimensional device looks just like a <i><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Portable_Hole_(Wondrous_Item)" title="SRD:Portable Hole (Wondrous Item)" class="mw-redirect">portable hole</a>. </i>Anything placed within it is immediately cast to another worldâ€”a parallel world, another planet, or a different plane (chosen randomly). If the well is moved, the random factor again comes into play. It can be picked up, folded, or rolled, just as a <i>portable hole </i>can be. Objects from the world the well touches can come through the opening just as easily as from the initiating place. (It is a two-way portal.)
