<p>Projectile weapons use ammunition: arrows (for bows), bolts (for crossbows), or sling bullets (for slings). When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a <a href="SRD_Free_Actions.html" title="SRD:Free Actions">free action</a>; crossbows and slings require an action for reloading. Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while normal ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.
</p><p>Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them (see <a href="SRD_Masterwork_Weapons.html" title="SRD:Masterwork Weapons">Masterwork Weapons</a>), and what happens to them after they are thrown.
