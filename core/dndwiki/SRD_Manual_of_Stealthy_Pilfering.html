<p><b>Manual of Stealthy Pilfering: </b>This guide to thievery grants any <a href="SRD_Rogue.html" title="SRD:Rogue">rogue</a> who spends a week studying its lessons a +1 inherent bonus to <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dexterity</a> and experience points sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. A character without any <a href="SRD_Rogue.html" title="SRD:Rogue">rogue</a> levels gains no bonus from the work, but if a divine spellcaster without <a href="SRD_Rogue.html" title="SRD:Rogue">rogue</a> levels scans even a single word she will lose 2dx1,000 XP and must make a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Will</a> save (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 20) or have 1 point of <a href="SRD_Wisdom.html" title="SRD:Wisdom">Wisdom</a> permanently drained. Except as indicated above, the writing in a <i>manual of stealthy pilfering </i>canâ€™t be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character ever benefit from reading a similar tome a second time.
