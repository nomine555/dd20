# INTRODUCTION

*Road to Destiny* is an adventure for 2nd level characters*.* In *Road
to Destiny*, the characters guard a caravan as it travels north,
capitalizing upon trade opportunities along the way. This adventure is a
series of detailed encounters that immerse the characters in the towns
and countryside they pass through, and provide rich and meaningful
experiences as they journey over 500 miles.

## Background

Far away in an eastern land, a coalition of Dark Spirits plotted to
seize the Imperial Throne, and to secure it against other claims,
destroyed four of the five ruling families. The fifth family, alerted to
the threat against them, prepared to flee over the roof of the world.
And yet, a traitor was amongst them.

Shirota, a scion of the fifth family, had already submitted to the Dark
Spirits who tasked him to spy on his family. When Shirota attempted to
warn his Dark masters of his family’s preparations, though, he was
caught and killed, and the family fled in the night. With no time for a
proper burial, Shirota was left to rot. When the Dark Spirits came upon
the abandoned estate they found Shirota’s unburied corpse. There they
performed foul rituals and Shirota arose to serve them once more, now as
a vampiric jiangshi, a stealer of breath and chi.

The Dark Spirits pursued the surviving family over the top of the world,
and Shirota went with them. When they caught up with the family in the
cold north of a western land, they destroyed an entire town to ensure
that everyone in the family was dead. The Spirits were convinced there
could be no survivors and returned to the eastern land to consolidate
their power and finalize their plans. But symbols, signs, and portents
spoke to Shirota in ways his Dark masters could not comprehend. The
slightest patterns and coincidences—from tea leaves, the migration of
birds, and broken crockery, to the morning dew on a spider&#39;s web—spoke a
secret language to the jiangshi, who became obsessed with the family
that slew him, and convinced that all of them had not been slain. But
the signs which he alone could fathom led him to an impossible
conclusion—he could only locate the survivors after his son had done so.

This represented a paradox because Shirota died childless, and his
internal organs had rotted away upon his fell rebirth. Yet Shirota
followed the signs, and with foul sorcery, he possessed the body of a
northman reaver. With his cold intelligence and the reaver’s warm living
body, the vampire sired two fraternal twin sons. Neither boy shared his
blood but both were tainted by his undead curse.

One boy, Ranulfr, was born with skin pale and gray. No amount of
sunlight could tan his features or redden his complexion. His hair was
pure white, and his eyes a blue so pale as to be almost milky. When he
came of age and showed no signs of growing out of his preternatural
appearance, his blood father declared him cursed. The young man was
driven to the south where he became an infamous bandit, known up and
down the coast as Ranulfr the White, or the &quot;White Wolf&quot;. Not knowing
the circumstances of his own conception, Ranulfr never realized he was a
dhamphir. As the years passed with no sign of ageing, Ranulfr came to
believe himself immortal.

The other son, Snorri, was born normal in appearance, free of unnatural
gifts, and enjoyed their father’s favor. He remained in the northern
land and became a reaver. Over the years, he had periodic contact with
his brother Ranulfr. The two have maintained a tenuous relationship and
meet in the south on occasion. At a disreputable port of call, Ranulfr
sells his brother the prisoners he has captured. These prisoners are
taken to the north to be resold as thralls. Despite this cooperation,
Ranulfr’s agelessness remains a bone of contention between them such
that Snorri was driven to tear out his own eye and replace it with a
magic stone, which shields him from the effects of aging and earned him
the name One-Eye.

In recent years, One-Eye has become an old man and the leader of his own
band of reavers. Ranulfr had lapsed into ennui, more a mystery and
legend to the people of the southern coast than the great terror he was
25 years ago. Yet now, Shirota, far off in the eastern land sees omens
manifest as he foretold so long ago. Ranulfr stirs to sudden ferocious
activity, drawn instinctively by forces he does not understand. And Old
One-Eye is finally struck by his undead heritage, and becomes consumed
by a wasting disease born of his tainted heritage. For an Imperial Heir
is on the road north at last, and her path is due to cross with the sons
of Shirota...

## Adventure Summary
Having been hired to protect a caravan that is transporting a young
eastern woman to a far northern city, the party departs Mirador, a small
coastal town and heads north towards Camford, a significant point for
the caravan to trade and restock supplies. En route, they are accosted
by thieving goblins who attempt to draw off their stoutest defenders to
raid the caravan of its goods. Once at Camford, the party hears rumors
of a legendary bandit, the &quot;White Wolf&quot; who has returned to terrorize
the coastline after decades of inactivity, and a rogue attempts to
exploit them to smuggle a stolen treasure out of town.

* On the road again, their next stop is the town of Wolvington, a
community once stricken by a dire plague. Decades ago, Wolvington’s
leaders invested in a magical jewel that detects the presence of plague
carriers. Only a few of Wolvington’s oldest citizens know the device is
actually a fake, designed to put fears to rest. The town&#39;s new Sheriff,
entrusted with the secret, is using it for extortion and a citizen who
remembers the dark days of the plague might ask for the PCs&#39; help to put
a stop to the crooked lawman’s scheme.  
* With Wolvington behind them, the party braves a shortcut through
Gnarlwood Forest towards Port Haven. On the way they are beset by
Ranulfr’s raiders, who attempt to capture the eastern woman. If the
bandits are successful, the PCs have an opportunity to rescue her later
at Port Haven, before she is sold to Old One-Eye’s band.  
* As the caravan continues north, the party comes across another caravan
that has been attacked by ogres. The PCs can turn a blind eye, or help
their fellow travelers by mounting an impromptu rescue before it’s too
late. Finally, in the last leg of their journey, Ranulfr the White
confronts them at last—fulfilling the destiny his vampire sire
envisioned over half a century ago.

&gt;* **Boxed Text—When To Use It and When Not To**  
&gt;* Boxed text is an art form in and of itself, and there is a time and
place when to use it. It can be of great value when an apt description
of a room or dialogue from an NPC is required. However, when it comes
out of nowhere, like during a wilderness journey, it can be a dead
giveaway that something is about to happen. It is at these times it is
best to keep it simple and not rouse the players suspicions any earlier
than you have to—after all, sometimes a path through the woods is just a
path through the woods!

# SET UP

**The Decoy Group**
* 3 *Whistlewhip Goblins*  
* *Skeeter, the Decoy Leader* 

**The Assault Group**
* *Draft Horse*  
* *Sputterlick, the Assault Leader*
* 4 *Whistlewhip Goblins*  


The caravan&#39;s route takes the PCs north along a coastal road, and then
northeast toward Camford. The entire journey to Camford spans 133 miles,
which takes 5 days. Goblins are an ever-present threat in this region.
The savage creatures are too ravenous and vicious to properly farm,
fish, or create proper long-term structures, so their favorite means of
survival is to prey upon more industrious creatures while they salvage
their debris. Between Mirador and Camford, a small tribe of goblins
ambushes the party’s caravan.

The Whistlewhip goblin tribe maintains a ragged
existence. The numerous existing goblin tribes to the south prevent
their move into more populated territory. Yet, this relative scarcity
only serves to make the Whistlewhips more devious and cunning. The
occasional caravans who take a direct route to Camford are among their
favorite targets.

## Tactics
The goblins are split into two groups: a decoy group, and an assault
group. Both groups are hiding off to the side of the road in sparse
forest terrain. The decoy group is intended to draw the caravan’s
defenders away from the caravan itself. They present themselves as a
small, easily-intimidated group in the hope of luring caravan *Guards*
into a chase. If the decoys are successful, the assault group emerges to
launch the real attack. If the decoy group fails to draw guards away,
both groups of goblins attack together.

Alert PCs might spot the goblins prior to the start of the ambush with a
successful DC 26 *Wisdom* (Perception) check. For every 1 point by which
the DC is exceeded, the PC spots one or more goblins from 10 feet
farther south than the southernmost goblin raider (see Map).

One goblin from the decoy group is posted near a small tree at the side
of the road. When the caravan draws close, or if the goblins know they
have been spotted, this goblin takes a standard action to push the tree,
which has been sawed at the base in preparation, over the road. The tree
requires at least one minute of labor by 2–3 characters to remove it
before the wagons can advance. The decoy goblins then make ranged
attacks while falling back behind the fallen tree. Once the PCs confront
them they avoid positions where a charge is possible and ready to fall
back to just before the PCs can close with them in melee. Their overall
goal is to lead the caravan defenders to the north and then off the side
of the road where their leader, *Skeeter*, can cast her *entangle* spell
on the forest ground to keep them stuck and busy while the assault group
then launches their attack upon the caravan.

The decoy goblins are denoted **D** on Map A, and Skeeter by **Sk**.

The assault group leader, Sputterlick, makes the
determination when to attack the caravan, based upon how successful
*Skeeter* and the decoy group have diverted *Guards*.

The raid group doesn’t fight ‘fair’ in any sense of the word. They don’t
hesitate to set the wagons on fire, attack the horses, cut the horses’
harnesses, and in general mob any one on the ground.

## Treasure
PCs who follow the goblins&#39; tracks with a successful DC 16
*Wisdom* (Survival) check locate their make-shift ‘fort’ in the woods
after an hour. Besides typical goblin refuse, a successful DC 15 *Wisdom*
(Perception) check locates a dilapidated strongbox that *Sputterlick*
withholds from the rest of the tribe. The strongbox can be opened with a
key that Sputterlick keeps on a cord around his neck, a successful DC 10
*Dexterity* check requiring *Thieve&#39;s Tools*, or simply smashed open with a
DC 17 *Strength* check. The box contains 100 gp worth of various gold,
silver, and copper coins.

AT A GLANCE
---
* *Detect magic*:
 * There is nothing magical. 
* *Wisdom* (Perception) DC 26:
 * To spot the goblins prior to the start of the ambush. For every 1 point by which the DC is exceeded, the PC spots one or more goblins from 10 feet farther.

CONCLUSION
---
The only objective here is to protect the caravan before reaching [[Camford]].

(Bear in mind the *Days Traveled and Story Events*).

# SOCIAL SCENE
When the PCs&#39; caravan reaches Camford, they find an area set aside for
caravans to the south of town. Here, caravans can park, circle their
wagons, and strike a campfire. A public well is available for groups to
draw water in order to cook, clean, and water their animals. The town is
not walled, but a *Guard* post is established where the main road diverts
into town. A wooden gate can be lowered to prevent a caravan from riding
through town.

Common practice for the town *Guard* is to permit each caravan to drive a
single horse-drawn wagon into town to trade. This discourages congestion
in the streets and keeps the town from being overrun. It is not uncommon
for townspeople to visit the campground fires as well, knowing that some
caravans supplement their trade with music, dancing, gambling, and
fortune-telling in the evening.

The road continues north past Camford and along Cinder Lake for 32
miles. Just past Cinder Lake is the northern half of Lantern River,
where a ferry crosses near the town of Wolvington.

Camford gets its name from the Gaimen College, which is attached to a
private school of magic called the Dusk Institute. Gaimen College is an
adjunct to the Institute and serves as a preparatory school for those
with wealth who seek a higher education. The College and the Institute
drive much of the town’s economy and play a central role in the
community. The community qualifies as a large town from an economic
perspective, though its population is closer to that of a small town.

There is no caravan encounter in Camford itself, but the PCs can make
repairs to their caravan, purchase upgrades, and buy and sell trade
goods to further finance their journey. If the PCs mention that they are
traveling north to merchants, they leanr that a number of caravans have
become uneasy about traveling north due to bandits. Southern merchants
seek to encourage brave traders to transport their goods to the north
before their revenue streams dry up.

## Bandit Rumors in Camford
PCs who wish to learn more about the bandits, or are just curious about
local news as it pertains to their journey can make a *Charisma* check to
gather information.

* **DC 10** A group of bandits have become organized under a strong
leader, and have been conducting raids north of Camford. The worst
activity has been reported north of Wolvington, so the trip is
considered relatively safe at least that far.  
* **DC 15** The bandits not only steal goods but take prisoners—none of
whom have been seen since. Survivors say the bandit leader is a
northman.  
* **DC 20** The bandits call their leader the &quot;White Wolf&quot;, apparently in
reference to his white hair and pale skin.

## Campground Confrontation
The PCs become embroiled in a robbery which took place in town just
prior to their arrival. The thief is a gnome named *Vaylenchek*, and the
item is a rare spellbook he &quot;liberated&quot; from the Dusk Institute. The
spellbook in question, the *Folio of the Faebinder*, is a treatise on
fey magic with an emphasis on illusions and enchantments. Although the
Institute does not know the identity of the author, the book has an
uncommon slant towards the use of illusions and enchantments on fey
creatures which are often resistant to such magic.

What few know is that the author learned these secrets while the lover
of a powerful Fey Baron from the Faerie Lands. After the author ferreted
out many magical secrets, he slipped away from his faerie patron with
nary a word and returned to the Material Plane. While the author’s final
fate is unknown, the Baron placed a bounty on the book over a century
ago. Just this past year, while on a visit to the Dusk Institute,
*Vaylenchek* noticed the volume among the reserved collection. When he
returned to his gnomish community within the Somnos Forest, he confirmed
the reward is still posted and made his plans. Vaylenchek returned to
Camford a few weeks ago and carefully infiltrated the Institute. Rather
than thwart the Institute’s magical wards and protections, Vaylenchek
played a cautious gambit. By way of invisibility, cunning, and stealth
he observed the instructors at the Institute for over a week until he
knew the required passwords to bypass the library’s defenses. He
succeeded in the liberation of the tome, but not before he triggered an
unexpected mechanical trap which mildly injured him. The gnome hid the
book in a specially-prepared satchel. The satchel contains thin sheets
of lead sewn into the sides to block divinations like *locate object*.

Unfortunately for *Vaylenchek*, the missing tome was noticed much sooner
than he anticipated. A mere hour after his flight, the Institute hired a
freelance detective, *Lexia Harken*, to recover the book. Lexia has
tracked Vaylenchek throughout town. The PCs become involved when the
gnome selects their caravan to be the device by which he smuggles the
tome out of town. His initial plan is to keep a safe distance and
reclaim it later.

## The Liberator
* *Vaylenchek, the Liberator*  

PCs&#39; newly-acquired trade goods so they carry it back to their wagons
without their knowledge. In this case, Vaylenchek shadows the PCs so he
can either steal it back or make contact with them later, once they’ve
left town.

Alternatively, the gnome can use *Stealth*, *Sleight of Hand*, or
*invisibility* to stash it somewhere among the PCs&#39; wagons directly. In
this case, the PCs should have an opportunity to catch him.

Finally, *Vaylenchek* could approach and seek employment with the caravan,
and stash the tome with his gear. In this final option, he hopes to hide
amidst the travelers and go unnoticed, and that the PCs will resist
being questioned or having their wagons searched.

When *Lexia* arrives to question the PCs, Vaylenchek might not be present
if the tome was smuggled inside the PC’s trade goods earlier. If he is
present, he should either be invisible, hiding, or a newly-recruited
member of the PCs&#39; caravan crew.


&gt;* **Folio of the Faebinder**  
&gt;* *Wondrous item, unique*
&gt;* The leather covers of this spellbook are dyed bright blue, and the spine
and corner protectors are cold iron. The pages are fine, crisp paper
with ivy designs scrolled in green ink along the borders. The delicate
handwriting is bright red in contrast. It weighs 2 pounds. The *Folio of
the Faebinder* contains the following wizard spells:
&gt;* -   1st Level: *charm person*, *color spray*, *detect magic*, *disguise
    self*, *feather fall*, *illusory script*, *silent image*, *sleep*,
    *tasha&#39;s hideous laughter*
&gt;* -   2nd Level: *blur*, *mirror image*, *nystul&#39;s magic aura*,
    *phantasmal force*
&gt;* -   3rd Level: *fly*, *hypnotic pattern*, *major image*, *nondetection*
&gt;* -   4th Level: *confusion*, *hallucinatory terrain*
&gt;* When you prepare spells from this book, you are considered to be
proficient in *Intelligence* (Nature) checks for 24 hours. If you are
already proficient in this skill, you gain a +2 bonus on *Intelligence*
(Nature) checks instead. Within this time, you can increase the DC of
one enchantment or illusion spell that you cast by 2, or by 4 if the
target has the fey type.

## The Detective
* *Lexia the Detective*  

Once it has been determined if and how the PCs meet
*Vaylenchek*, and the circumstances by which the *Folio of the Faebind*er
is hidden on their wagons, *Lexia* arrives to investigate. She is a fair
woman but this is a contract with the Institute, and a matter of
reputation for her. She means to see the book recovered and the &quot;thief&quot;
caught if possible. The Institute has also offered her 850 gp for the
book’s return.

*Lexia* arrives at the campground from the town to the north. She is
accompanied by one of the Camford guard. This doesn’t make Lexia an
“official” representative of Camford law enforcement, but the *Guard* does
lend weight to her ability to investigate and ask questions. The guard
is also a witness to everything which transpires, and if the PCs are
completely uncooperative it reflects on them poorly. If the party is
unwarrantedly hostile to Lexia, you should consider penalties to all
social skill rolls and other penalties to their ability to trade and do
business in town.

Lexia’s tracking abilities have led her to the campground but now the
trail ends. Her recourse is to visit each campsite and ask questions.
Most travelers are reluctant to answer any questions but don’t want
their ability to trade significantly impacted. *Lexia*’s questions are in
the vein of, “Has anyone suspicious come around lately? Has anyone tried
to get you to buy or accept anything from them?” When she arrives at the
PCs&#39; caravan, she may ask if she can search their wagons, though she has
no legal authority to make such a demand. While Lexia has no legal
authority she may try a *Charisma* (Deception) check contested by the PCs&#39;
*Wisdom* (Insight) checks to convince the party she does. Lexia has an
unfriendly attitude towards the PCs at first, based more upon her
suspicions than a genuine dislike. A successful DC 21 *Charisma*
(Persuasion) check allays her suspicions and convinces her to search
elsewhere. *Lexia* only fights if strongly provoked.





## Development
The Fey Baron that placed a bounty on the book believed
herself to be wronged—taken advantage of by the author for the knowledge
contained within the book. Thus, *Vaylenchek* sees himself as putting an
ancient wrong right. Yet, the Dusk Institute bought the book decades ago
in good faith and with no prior knowledge of its history. They do not
see it as fair that they should suffer the cost of the book through no
misdeed on their part. *Lexia* Harken may be zealous but only seeks to
recover actual stolen property. There are merits to both positions and
the PCs are free to choose either side.

If the PCs somehow discover the book and fully cooperate with Lexia, she
offers them a portion of her own reward money—200 gp, but with a
successful DC 20 *Charisma* (Persuasion) check she can be persuaded to
halve the full reward of 850 gp with them. If she recovers the book
without their help, the PCs are told they’ll be lucky if she doesn’t
mobilize the town *Guard* to run them out of the area. Finally, if her
exchange with the party resulted in combat, she likely flees in the face
of superior numbers, but swiftly returns with a number of the Camford
*Guard* to back her up.

If *Lexia*’s investigation comes up empty, *Vaylenchek* will shadow the
caravan on its journey until he can steal his book back. Alternatively,
if he is a part of the crew, he stays with the caraven until he’s sure
there is no pursuit, and then joins another caravan heading back south.
If the stolen spellbook is discovered later, Vaylenchek does his best to
maintain possession, but offers to let the PCs copy spells out of it
freely.

### Story Awards
If the PCs discover what *Vaylenchek* is up to and make
a decision on what to do about it on their own terms (even if that means
working with him), the party earns XP as if they had defeated him in
combat. If the PCs thwart Lexia’s investigation with minimal
confrontation, they earn XP as if they had defeated her in combat. If
they simply turn over the book and Vaylenchek to her, it counts as
defeating him and not her.

AT A GLANCE
---
* Players can make a *Charisma* check to gather information there (and, maybe, discover about the white wolf).
* *Detect magic*:
 * There is nothing magical. 
* *Detect evil and good*:
 * There are not aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead creatures.
 * There are not places or objects that has been magically consecrated or desecrated. 

CONCLUSION
---
Once the party solve (or not) the problem with the book and Vaylenchek, the caravan will go to [[Wolvington]].

(Bear in mind the *Days Traveled and Story Events*).

# SOCIAL INTERACTION

The town of Wolvington is 32 miles north of Camford, and requires a
ferry trip across the Lantern River to access. PCs who succeed at a DC
15 *Intelligence* (History) check can recall that Wolvington had a
reputation as a safe haven for people with maladies approximately 40
years ago. When the town was subsumed by a large city-state to the south
there was an unfortunate purity and cleansing campaign waged against the
town’s citizenry, and the “problem” was declared resolved. Many still
consider Wolvington to be an odd rural community, but both the regional
and local governments are content to forget the past and discourage
public talk of anything outside the ordinary about the town now.

## Roadside Conversation
A few miles south of the ferry, the PCs&#39; caravan overtakes the
horse-drawn cart of an elderly farmer, Hortus Ulby. Hortus flags them
down, introduces himself, and makes them an offer. Hortus has 4 units of
trade goods—particularly fresh and healthy produce from his farm. He
offers to sell them to the PCs at cost (10 gp each) if they are
interested in a resale opportunity at Wolvington. The exceptional
quality and freshness of his goods grants a +2 bonus on *Charisma*
(Persuasion) checks to sell them at higher than the market rate of 20 gp
each.

If questioned why he doesn’t want to take his goods to market himself
and therefore obtain a better price for himself directly, Hortus
grudgingly makes an admission: “I don’t cotton to messing with that fool
of a Sherriff they got up there now. Not today anyway. On the bright
side, I don’t think he’ll pester you folks—not being local and all.”
Hortus is hesitant to elaborate on his comment, but if the PCs prompt
him or appear friendly he elaborates.

&gt; Wolvington does some odd things, but for good reasons. The town relies
on trade, so merchants and caravans need to feel safe going through
there. Similarly, folks who have lived there for generations need to
feel safe that nobody is going to stir up trouble. Forty years ago there
was a trouble with a plague and the matter was put to rest. At that
time, it was the job of the Sheriff to make sure there were no further
troubles. To protect itself, the town invested in a magical jewel which
only glows when in the presence of the plague, or someone who might be a
carrier. The plague is said to run in families, you see. If someone
tries to enter town and the jewel glows, the town *Guard* turns them back
at the gate, and everybody feels safe.  
&gt; Hortus lowers his voice carefully. “Now don’t be tellin’ anybody I told
you this, but the whole thing is a sham. Forty years ago, folks were
putting the torch to their neighbor’s house for no cause but fear, and
the whole community was tearing itself apart. The plague stone is a
fake and it always has been. The Sheriff can turn it on and off whenever
he wants, and all it does is glow. Furthermore, it ain’t been seen to
glow in a dog’s age. The plague died out years ago, but the *plague
stone* puts folks&#39; minds at rest. The old Sheriff used it only rarely,
and as an excuse to keep undesirables out of town. Keeping the peace is
the Sheriff’s real job.  
&gt; Problem is, the old Sheriff passed away last year and we got ourselves a
new one. This fellah—Burniss is his name—he was alright at first. He
knows the secret, of course, except lately he’s been asking for
‘donations’ from farm folk coming into town, and from what I hear, those
families that once had a history of the plague. He plays at it as being
for his retirement fund, new equipment, and the like. Ha! More like to
pad his purse and buy liquor! If folks don’t pay, he suggests the
*plague stone* might just light up someday. If it does, it means
scandal, accusations, and being run out of town. That being said,
Burniss doesn’t fool with travelers from the south. That would lead to
too many questions, and outside interest. That’s why I wanted to sell my
goods to you. It&#39;s better to sell at cost, than to take the pinch from
that thief.”

The following are some questions the PCs might ask, as well as Hortus’s
responses.

**How do you know all of this?**
&gt; “I know a little nature magic, and I’m
old enough to remember the bad times. Some of us have been around a long
time, long enough to figure a few things out.”

**What was the plague?**
&gt; “I’d rather not get into it. Let’s just say, it
was a problem that could have been contained within the community,
except some religious folks from outside came and decided they knew what
was best for everybody else. As a result a lot of people got hurt and
killed on either side. Someone came up with the idea of the *plague
stone* as a way for everybody to go forward with their lives. It was a
means to show the matter was settled, so we could all just get along.
Problem is, this new Sheriff—he’s rockin’ the boat with his greed.”

**Has the plague really died out?**
&gt; “Does it matter? Merchants and
caravans ain’t had no trouble with sickness in 40 years prior to this
and there’s no reason they’re gonna start now. The folks of Wolvington
got a handle on this, so long as a certain someone doesn’t stir things
up that are nobody’s business.”

**How could the Sheriff make the stone glow?**
&gt; “He&#39;ll know the secret to
it from his predecessor, some command phrase or word I expect. He keeps
the plague stone under lock and key at the town jail when it’s not on
display at the gate.”

**What can be done about the Sheriff?**
&gt; “Ah, now that’s an interesting
question!”

Hortus “needs” to sell his produce, but what the old druid-farmer
“wants” is to persuade some adventurers to help the Wolvington
community. This entire conversation is a means to discover something
about the party and to gauge their reaction to his story. It is
indirect, but for what Hortus has in mind, it is safer than being
forthright. If the PCs give the impression they are decent and
trustworthy people, Hortus makes them an offer.

&gt; “Sheriff Burniss needs to go, but that’s the town’s concern, not yours.
Myself and some other concerned folk would rather do it without an
unpleasant confrontation. I think if the Sheriff’s racket was exposed
before the whole town, he’d have the good sense to pack up and leave.
Our reliance on the plague stone also needs to come to an end. There’s
no need to rely on magic as a surrogate for common sense. We’ve taken up
a collection to compensate any group that would do us a favor. Steal the
stone out from beneath the Sheriff’s nose. We’ll gather folks up and
show the whole town it ain’t real, and we’ll get his shake-down racket
out in the open. He won’t be able to fight the whole community and we
can see him on his way. The only thing which stops us now is that some
folks still believe in the stone, so we need to pass it around and show
them. Then there won’t be any doubt about it.”

**If the PCs agree**, Hortus agrees to pay the party 500 gp if they steal
the *plague stone* and deliver it to him. Hortus says his grandson will
be posted a mile south of town, and once the party reports the stone’s
acquisition, Hortus’s group will assemble, tender the promised amount,
and then proceed to confront the Sheriff. The party can persuade Hortus
to increase the amount by 100 gp with a successful DC 20 *Charisma*
(Persuasion) check, but no more. As it stands, he represents a handful
of local people who are tired of the new Sheriff. Each of them has
contributed towards the bounty, but they have no further financial
resources to offer. Hortus&#39;s story is accurate, and if the PCs make a DC
20 *Wisdom* (Insight) check they receive a hunch that he has no motive
other than to expose the Sheriff as a crook.

**If the PCs decline**, Hortus asks for their discretion about what they
discussed and wishes them good luck on their travels. The old man would
prefer they not tell the Sheriff, but he doesn’t fret over the prospect
of the PCs betraying his confidence—he believes the matter will be
settled soon, one way or another.

**If the PCs ask how they’re supposed to steal the plague stone**, Hortus
explains they&#39;ll need to devise a plan which works well for them, but he
nevertheless offers some advice. First, he suggests they continue their
trip to town and assess the situation. He describes the gate and how the
*plague stone* is hung above it during the day (see area **C1**, below).
He warns that while they could assault the gate, it would surely lead to
an attack from the *Guards*, and Hortus doesn’t want any townsfolk
seriously hurt or killed—even *Sheriff Burniss*. Hortus mentions that the
guards on the wall are often bored, lazy, and thirsty, and could be
distracted while the *plague stone* is stolen out from beneath their
noses. With the *plague stone* locked up at night while the Sheriff
frequents the local tavern, a stealthy PC might be able to pickpocket
the keys while someone clever or attractive keeps the Sheriff busy.
Finally, Hortus muses that they could break into the town jail after
nightfall and steal the stone that way.




AT A GLANCE
---
* *Detect magic*:
 * *The Plague Stone* is magical, and so they are the potions of the Sheriff in area G4. 


CONCLUSION
---
Players can accept or not Hortus&#39; offer about stealing the stone. After it, the caravan continues to [[Shortcut through the wood]].

# SET UP
* 4 *Northmen Raiders*  
* 4 *Riding Horses*

The road out of Wolvington follows the east bank of the Lantern River
towards the town of Raven’s Eye for 75 miles before it diverts almost
another 70 miles to get to the town of Port Haven. Cusp proposes an
alternate route: to go back across the Lantern River, follow the west
bank, and take a shortcut through the Gnarlwood Forest for a 110 mile
trek. This shaves an entire day off the journey, and avoids the
unpleasant swampy community of Raven’s Eye. Assuming the party takes
Cusp’s shortcut, on the third day after leaving Wolvington, the caravan
takes the shortcut through the Gnarlwood and ends that third day 14
miles outside of Port Haven. The details of this encounter transpire
while the caravan is traveling through the forest on a well-established
trail.

## Terrain
The path Cusp takes is broad and easy for the wagons. Terrain should not
play a great role.

## Tactics
*Ranulfr* has more than one group of bandits patrolling
this area. The White Wolf himself is currently patrolling elsewhere, but
a small group of his raiders come across the party’s caravan as it moves
through the Gnarlwood.

The raiders have a strategy they’ve adopted since their master set them
to search for Kikuko. When the caravan comes within sight, they avoid
any obvious interest in what the caravan carries, and they keep their
weapons sheathed. As a group they ride past the caravan, nodding hello,
and returning waves and greetings if offered, before they ride out of
sight. However, they’re actually checking faces for an attractive
Eastern woman (Kikuko), counting heads, and determining in which wagons
the caravan’s defenders are located. This is not obvious, but a PC who
makes a successful DC 20 *Wisdom* (Insight) check has a sense of unease
and untrustworthiness about the group. The raiders do not appear as
northmen from a racial perspective, but a successful DC 10 *Intelligence*
check indicates they were trained by a northman or heavily exposed to
that culture, as evidenced by their choice of melee weapon, dress, and
overall style. The caravan NPCs should make no particular effort to
conceal themselves unless the PCs advise them first. This allows the
raider’s strategy to have a chance to work, while it grants the PCs all
the credit if they’re smart enough not to fall for it.

After sufficient time has passed for the party to lower their defenses,
the raiders ride back towards the caravan prepared for a full attack. If
they spotted Kikuko, her capture becomes their primary goal. The *raiders*
use sleep arrows to subdue defenders.

The raiders have rope-ties which are simple knotted loops of spider silk
rope they can slip over wrists or ankles as a move action to restrain an
opponent. The ties have 4 hp and can be burst with a DC 23 *Strength*
check. The raiders do not take any opportunity to coup de grace PCs, or
press an attack against characters that are helpless. The raider’s
horses are not combat trained. Their primary function is a means for the
raiders to attack the wagons in motion.


## After the fight
**If the raiders manage to escape with Kikuko**, Cusp suggests that the raiders might transport captives to Pirate’s Landing or Port Haven. Since Port Haven is the closer of the two ports and is on the way to Pirate’s Landing, it is a logical first place to search.

**If the PCs capture and interrogate one of the raiders**, they are loath to
betray *Ranulfr*, yet a successful DC 12 *Charisma* (Intimidation) check
loosens their tongues. They describe the “White Wolf”, and report that
over a month ago he dreamt of an Eastern woman. She has become his
obsession, and has vowed to stop at nothing to find her. If pressed on
why, the raiders look extremely uncomfortable and feign, “You don’t
bring that subject up with him.” If pressed harder, they blurt out, “He
wants to know why he is immortal!” The raiders can offer that their
leader has not aged a single day in the last 25 years, and no one knows
why. Yet some madness has convinced him it has to do with a woman who
looks exactly like Kikuko. If allowed, the raiders produce a folded
charcoal sketch on heavy paper. The illustration is the exact likeness
of Kikuko, which they report the White Wolf drew from the memory. They
can offer no further explanation other than their orders are to search
for her with every raid they perform.

AT A GLANCE
---
* *Detect magic*:
 * There is nothing magical. 
* *Wisdom* (Insight) DC 20: 
 * To have a  sense of unease and untrustworthiness from the raiders about the group.
* *Intelligence* DC 10:
 * To notice the raiders were trained by a northman or heavily exposed to
that culture, as evidenced by their choice of melee weapon, dress, and
overall style.

CONCLUSION
---
Allow the raiders to kidnap Kikuo, if they can. Players go [[Port Haven]] to find her or to search for the White Wolf.

# INVESTIGATION SCENE

The journey from Wolvington to Port Haven has been approximately 110
miles, with the party arriving early afternoon on the fourth day of this
leg of the trip. Port Haven is one of two ports with questionable
reputations. Port Haven earns its name from being the tamer of the two.
Most sailing merchants can put into port without undue fear of piracy.
This does not make Port Haven a safe city, however. The authorities
place a premium on peace and safe trade over actual justice. *Ranulfr* the
White Wolf uses Port Haven to meet his estranged brother One-Eye. The
brothers have always had an unusual relationship. Ranulfr has always
resented One-Eye’s “normalcy” and acceptance in the northlands, whereas
One-Eye resents Ranulfr’s immortality, so much so that he plucked out
one of his own eyes to gain some portion of it. Yet, they are the
other’s only living kinfolk and maintain a brotherly, if strained,
relationship. As a matter of business, Old One-Eye usually buys
Ranulfr’s captured thralls and transports them for resale back to the
northlands.

When the PCs arrive in Port Haven, certain events are in motion. Old
One-Eye has fallen sick from a wasting disease while at sea and now lies
below deck slowly dying. The crew need provisions and have been forced
to stop at Port Haven, so the first mate has elected to confer with
*Ranulfr*.

This encounter introduces the PCs to *Ranulfr* before their final
confrontation and permits them to get a look at the man whose personal
legend has shadowed their journey thus far. Additionally, if the raiders
managed to capture and abduct Kikuko in Part Four, this is an
opportunity for the PCs to rescue her.

If the party asks locals about Kikuko, slavers, or human trafficking, it
is quickly suggested the docks might be the best place to ask.
Additional information can be learnt as follows.

## Bandit Rumors in Port Haven

PCs who wish to learn more about the White Wolf and his presence in Port
Haven can make a *Charisma* check to gather information.

* **DC 10** The White Wolf is known in Port Haven and Pirate’s Landing.
His real name is said to be Ranulfr, and he is a northman with pale
skin, white hair, and pale blue eyes. He is said to have been around
forever but doesn&#39;t seem to change.  
* **DC 15** Ranulfr is circumspect while in Port Haven. He is said to
traffic in thralls but keeps his activities quiet, and prefers to avoid
direct confrontation with city authorities whenever possible. He keeps
primarily to the harbor district while in town. He often trades with an
aged northman named Old One-Eye. Ranulfr is said to be exiled from his
homeland.  
* **DC 20** Old One-Eye is said to be Ranulfr’s older brother, and both
have come to Port Haven and Pirate’s Landing for decades. Old One-Eye is
a minor lord or clan chief back in the northlands, and is a ring-giver
to many property owners. He is an infamous reaver and pirate. Ranulfr
was sedentary for the past several years but has abruptly become active
again.  
* **DC 25** Ranulfr is actually Old One-Eye’s fraternal twin and was even
born first. Old One-Eye has aged whereas Ranulfr has not. One-Eye takes
his name from when he tore out his own eye and replaced it with a
magical one that keeps him as vital as a young man—except now some
strange sickness has finally brought him low.

## Port Haven

&gt; Along the side of a long, wooden pier is a large longship with a single
mast and benches for rowers with oars upended between rounded shields
mounted on the sides. Across from the ship is a large wooden platform
built into the pier for loading and unloading cargo. A solitary rowboat
is tied off next to the loading platform.

The sea water off the side of the pier is 15 feet deep and for the
purposes of Swim checks is considered calm.

Even if Kikuko wasn&#39;t abducted, the PCs still have a reason to be down
at the docks. The caravan needs to sell and buy trade goods, and the
best trade goods are those which are hard to find and shipped in from
other areas far away. A port is the best place to buy and sell rare
items and a perfect place for the caravan to conduct its trade. You can
grant a +2 bonus on *Charisma* (Persuasion) checks when selling goods at
the docks, or selling goods purchased from the docks in other towns.

## Ranulfr Revealed
* *Ranulfr the White Wolf*  
* 2 *Ranulfr Raiders*  

*Ranulfr* has just visited his sick twin inside the
longship, and is now on the pier as he confers with Old One-Eye’s first
mate. Ranulfr believes One-Eye has little time left before he dies, and
he should be returned to the northlands where those who owe fealty to
One-Eye can conduct his funeral rites properly. The two also negotiate
the usual sale of thralls, four of which stand nearby with their hands
bound with rope. If she was abducted, Kikuko is also present and bound,
though Ranulfr has no intention of selling her to anyone. His obsession
is so great he won’t let her out of his sight.

**If Kikuko was abducted**, or if one or more of the raiders who failed in
an abduction attempt escaped, at least one of Ranulfr&#39;s men may spot and
recognize the PCs. If the PCs are recognized, *Ranulfr* prepares to defend
himself and quietly orders his men to get ready to shove the bound
thralls off the side of the pier where they’ll drown if no one helps
them quickly. If the fight starts to go poorly, one of the raiders
knocks Kikuko overboard as well. Ranulfr shouts “No! No! Not her!” in
shock and fury. Ranulfr wants to pull her from the water, but his own
men beg him to retreat for the sake of his own life. The bandit allows
himself to be hustled aboard the ship while his raiders cover his
retreat. The longship casts off without the thralls and Ranulfr enraged
at the loss of his prize.

**If Kikuko wasn&#39;t abducted**, this could instead be treated as a
roleplaying encounter; a chance to employ foreshadowing. If so, Kikuko
should be present with the party while in Port Haven. Situate the party
some distance to the east side of the docks, while *Ranulfr* and his men
congregate near the gangplank of the longship with no prisoners. Ranulfr
senses Kikuko’s presence with his entangled destinies ability. He stares
boldly at her and the party and grows enraged. His allies notice this
exchange, and physically restrain him from an ill-advised charge down
the pier towards the party. They hustle their master aboard the
longship, and immediately begin rowing out of the harbor. Ranulfr glares
menacingly before he calls mockingly out across the pier in Common,
“Another time and another place, woman! You will be mine!” Kikuko
shivers despite herself, and reports the sensation that &quot;the White Wolf
just seemed to know I was here.&quot;




## The Longship
* 12 *Northmen Raiders*  

Old One-Eye’s reavers want no fight at this time. Most
remain on the ship to protect it, repelling boarders, and leaving
*Ranulfr* to fight his own battles. Should a battle break out, they
prepare the longship to push off from the pier and row off. Twelve
remain armed and ready to repel boarders until any threat has retreated,
and any that fall are replaced each round until all 45 of the reavers
are defeated. 40 of the reavers are 1st-level barbarians, 4 are
3rd-level barbarians, and 1 is a 6th-level barbarian. With 45 barbarian
reavers on board, the capture of the longship is well beyond the
capabilities of the PCs at this time.


## Developments
If the PCs manage to kill *Ranulfr*, the events in Part
7 will change.

If the northmen reavers provide him with an escape route, they do not
transport him to the northlands, but put him ashore north of Port Haven.
From there he resumes his search for Kikuko as described in Part 7.

While bound, Kikuko and the thralls have the pinned condition and sink
rapidly while they hold their breath. Another creature can drag them to
the surface with a DC 12 *Strength* (Athletics) check, and anyone dragged
to the surface adjacent to the pier or loading platform can be hauled
out of the water as a standard action. This is a diversionary tactic and
those knocked in the water are only at risk if ignored.

Finally, the PCs may think to identify what *Ranulfr* is. This can be
accomplished with a DC 20 *Intelligence* (Religion). Bear in mind that
Ranulfr does not know what he is! If confronted at any point with this
information, it changes nothing. Ranulfr becomes confused and then angry
by the revelation. He’ll suspect it is untrue, and has difficulty
reconciling it as he (to his understanding) had a normal biological
father and he has a “normal” twin. His biological father’s magical
possession by a jiangshi and the unique passing of its curse through
this possession to his children is beyond anyone’s ability to guess.

AT A GLANCE
---
* *Detect magic*:
 * There is nothing magical. 
* *Intelligence* (Religion) DC 20: To identify *Ranulfr* is a Dhamphir.

CONCLUSION
---
After rescuing Kiuko (in case), party will find a [[Caravan Crisis]] in their way.

(Bear in mind the *Days Traveled and Story Events*).

# INVESTIGATION SCENE
The road from Port Haven heads north for approximately 60 miles to
Pirate’s Landing. With the forests now left behind, the terrain becomes
open with only small hills to the northwest on the second day of travel.

## Killers on the Road
The caravan spots a trail of smoke rising from the road ahead. Its
source is undetermined, but if the party sends scouts ahead they report
a burning wagon ahead and a caravan in chaos and disarray. Read the
following description to the scouts or to the main caravan group.

&gt; The wreckage of a covered wagon, almost burned to the ground, sits askew
on the road ahead. One of its horses lies dead in front of it, while the
other is missing. The scent of smoke and burning flesh hangs in the air.
Nearby, a smaller supply wagon sits on its side, its horse also absent,
and a large hole smashed through the base boards. The tracks of a third
wagon lead off the side of the road and away from the road. The
blackened corpse of an armored man lays in the burning wagon. The scene
is quiet except for the crackling hiss and sputter of the fire.

The following clues to what happened here can be ascertained by careful
observation. Judging by the number of wagons, most of the caravan
travelers are missing. Many of the food stuffs and supplies are also
missing, except for a few crates and barrels that are broken and left
behind with their contents—simple clothing and household items—spilled
out on the ground. The second horse that was hitched to the burning
wagon was cut loose. The horse hitched to the overturned supply wagon
was likely able to wrench itself loose and may still be dragging part of
its harness if it was not captured.

PCs that make a successful DC 12 *Intelligence* (Investigation) check can
surmise the burned victim died from bludgeoning damage and was already
dead when the wagon caught fire. A successful DC 10 *Intelligence*
(Investigation) check can ascertain the hole in the floorboard of the
overturned wagon was either a huge club, or a fist the size of a ham.

## Gathering Clues

PCs who wish to gather clues can make an *Intelligence* (Investigation) or *Wisdom* (Survival) check to learn the following facts.  
* **DC 10** There is evidence of a pitched battle. A handful of broken
arrows can be found. The wreckage suggests the attackers used large
blunt weapons, whereas the defenders used blades and bows. The trail of
the third wagon pulled by two horses leads off the road to the east. The
horses appear panicked and had no driver.  
* **DC 13** Three sets of tracks lead to the northwest in the direction of
some small hills. These tracks can be followed at half the PCs normal
speed.  
* **DC 15** The tracks which lead northwest were made by Large humanoid
creatures. They must weigh in excess of 500 pounds each from the depth
of the tracks in firm ground. A second set of tracks, those of a
Medium-sized humanoid, lead in the direction of a copse of trees to the
northeast, about 100 yards away.  
* **DC 20** There is evidence that three Medium-sized humanoids were
captured and then carried off to the northwest.

If the PCs follow the trail of the missing wagon, they can locate it
after an hour, or 30 minutes while on horseback. The covered wagon is
undamaged, but the horses are very skittish and tired. The wagon still
contains supplies, bedding, and personal possessions one might expect to
find on a traveling caravan. A successful DC 15 *Wisdom* (Animal Handling)
check allows a character to take immediate control of the wagon,
otherwise the horses require an hour to calm down.

## Finding Aeysha
PCs who follow the single Medium-sized set of tracks to
the northeast, towards the copse of trees, find the tracks end there. A
17 year old human woman, Aeysha Villani, hides up in one of the trees,
but a DC 16 *Wisdom* (Perception) check notices her. Having seen the PCs
draw up to the scene in a caravan but scared and wary of banditry, a
successful DC 17 *Charisma* (Persusasion) check is required to convince
her to climb down. If the party convinces Aeysha they’re not thieves and
are trying to help her, she describes the attack and begs for the PCs to
rescue her family who were taken as captives. Aeysha&#39;s family owns the
caravan that only an hour or so ago was attacked by three &quot;giants&quot;, and
in the ensuing chaos she fled and hid. She is visibly shaken by the
violence she&#39;s witnessed, and its clear that she has been crying. PCs
who make a successful DC 13 *Intelligence* check can discern the &quot;giants&quot;
are likely ogres, and that there is limited time before the ogres either
eat their captives, or do perverse and humiliating things to them (and
then eat them). If the PCs intend to rescue the Villanis, they had best
be quick!


AT A GLANCE
---
* *Wisdom* (Perception) DC 16:
 * To notice hidding Aeysha, an then:  
* *Intelligence* DC 13:
 * What Aeysha calls giants are ogres.
 

CONCLUSION
---
Players may want to look for the [[Ogre Cave]] or keep on moving and be found, at last, at [[The Fate of the White Wolf]].

# WHEN DESTINIES COLLIDE
After the events at Port Haven, Cusp is able to direct the caravan to
Pirate’s Landing without incident. *Ranulfr* has regrouped with his band
and has been in slow pursuit. The distance to the PCs&#39; final destination
is 200 miles, which requires at least 6 nights before they arrive. It is
on the sixth night that Ranulfr strikes, on the very eve of the next
step in the party’s grand quest.


## Set Up
* *Ranulfr the White Wolf*  
* 2 *Northmen Raiders*
* *Kenna White-Eyes*

The final encounter does not take place in a location the caravan
chances upon, but at their own campsite. A map depicting a typical
caravan campsite, with the wagons drawn in a protective circle, has been
provided.

*Ranulfr* has tracked the party down, and this time he
brings more magical assistance. *Kenna* White-Eyes is Ranulfr’s ally and
sometimes lover. The northwoman is a striking beauty with silver hair,
perfect fair skin, and milky white eyes. She dresses in black leather
armor and dark colors. A war priest, Kenna is drawn to acts of passion
and violence by forces beyond her comprehension. She is jealous of her
bandit lord’s unearthly fascination with Kikuko, and yet she also knows
what it is to be the slave to obsession. She hates him but is drawn
inexplicably towards him, and would pull away from Ranulfr if she could.
Like Kikuko, Kenna is tangled up in the strands of his story. If nothing
else, the pair have an unspoken empathy for each other few others would
understand.

The dhampir’s goal is to capture Kikuko. Ironically, *Ranulfr* doesn’t
know exactly what he’s going to do with her once he does, or why he is
compelled to capture her. He only knows she is somehow involved in the
mystery of his birth, and she is the object of an obsession he cannot
explain. He intends to capture her and if necessary kill every single
person who stands in his way.

*Ranulfr* stages his attack in the middle of the night to put the PCs at
the greatest disadvantage. Ranulfr and *Kenna* have darkvision, and he has
arranged for his reavers to have one *potion of darkvision* each.
Ranulfr studies the campsite from the furthest extent of his darkvision.
He is not especially stealthy but uses cover from the trees and the
darkness. His entangled destinies ability helps him focus on where
Kikuko is located before he orders the attack.


## Tactics
*Kenna* does not surrender. If brought to a helpless
state and then healed after *Ranulfr*’s death, she holds no acrimony
towards the party. She explains that her relationship with Ranulfr was
“complex”. If it suits the needs of the story, Kenna can become a new
ally or replacement character. She can sense the road the PCs travel is
fraught with conflict and is drawn like a moth to a flame.

&gt;* **What If Ranulfr Is Dead?**
&gt;* If Ranulfr was killed in Part Five, then it is Kenna White-Eyes who
leads the final attack against the PCs in revenge. Add two or three
extra raiders in place of Ranulfr.


AT A GLANCE
---
* *Detect magic*:
 * There is nothing magical. 
* *Detect evil and good*:
 * There are not aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead creatures.

# Conclusion

Although the story of *Ranulfr* the White Wolf is at an end, his obsession
with Kikuko remains an unresolved mystery. Unanswered questions
notwithstanding, the White Wolf pitted his destiny against the PCs&#39; and
was found wanting. The PCs final destination, the town of Saltcrest lies
only 8 miles ahead.

Shirota, the jiangshi sorcerer now knows that Kikuko is on her way to
claim her throne. The vampire does not share this information with the
Dark Spirits however, as his desire for revenge against his former
family is too personal, and too long has his oracular insights been
dismissed and mocked. Shirota keeps his counsel, and waits for the scion
of his former family to draw closer so it is he who is the instrument of
her destruction. In this way he means to prove himself at last to the
Dark Spirits, and bring meaning and purpose to his undeath.

If *Ranulfr* proves triumphant, then he takes Kikuko prisoner while he
tries to unravel the mystery of their connection. This may allow a new
group of heroes to arise to rescue her and see her on the road to
destiny.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Appendix One: Days Traveled and Story Events" tags="index @story-events" position="1153,757" size="100,100">
# Appendix One – Days Traveled and Story Events

To assist you in maintaining a calendar or log for your campaign, here
is an approximate chronology of events and miles traveled each day
throughout the Road to Destiny adventure. It assumes the default caravan
travel rate of 32 miles per day, but also notes locations where the
caravan might come to a halt early due to proximity to a town or event.
It also shows the days where no events take place, where you may wish to
generate a random encounter. The length of the entire journey is 541
miles.

* **1**. Starting Town to Monastery of the Wind: 58 miles. The PCs must
camp one day, and arrive late on the second day.  
* **2**. Monastery of the Wind to Goblin Ambush: 10 miles. The encounter
occurs late morning of the third day.  
* **3**. Goblin Ambush to Camford: 65 miles. The PCs must camp twice
before they arrive at Camford early on the 5th day, and presumably stay
the night.  
* **4**. Camford to Wolvington: 32 miles. The PCs arrive late afternoon on the 6th day and presumably stay the night.  
* **5.** Wolvington to Gnarlwood Ambush: 70 miles. The PCs must camp twice
and are attacked early on the 9th day.  
* **6.** Gnarlwood Ambush to Port Haven: 40 miles. The PCs must camp once
and arrive in Port Haven late morning on the 10th day and presumably
stay the night.  
* **7.** Port Haven to the Ruined Caravan: 17 miles. If the PCs stop to
help and fight the ogres that is the only progress they make on the 11th
day. Alternatively they arrive at Pirate’s Landing in the evening of the
12th day (subtract one day from future estimates).  
* **8.** Ruined Caravan to Pirate’s Landing: 45 miles. The PC must camp
once and arrive in Pirate Landing just before midday on the 13th day and
presumably spend the night.  
* **9.** Pirate’s Landing to Confrontation with Ranulfr: 192 miles. The
PCs must camp six times and are attacked after they make camp the final
night. The next morning is the 19th day.  
* **10.** Confrontation with Ranulfr to Saltcrest: 8 miles. The PCs arrive
at SaltCrest late morning on the 20th day.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Main Index" tags="index @index-main" position="124,545" size="100,100">

# WELCOME, ADVENTURER
You have in your hands a **Tabletop RPG** adventure designed to be mastered from a tablet.
This is a medieval-fantasy adventure that uses *SRD5 System* and can be adapted to any game world.

## What is a roleplaying game?
Roleplaying games consist of taking on roles, usually in fantasy worlds. You have to imagine how your adventurer would face the challenges presented by the game’s director. You play sitting around a table with your friends, with a few dice and ready to have a good time.

## What do I need to play?
To play this adventure, you need to be familiarized with the *SRD5 System* and have dice and a pencil and paper. **The adventure itself gives you the necessary rules to resolve each encounter**. You will also need character sheets.

You can read a [synopsis of the adventure](./index.html?param=@resumen) or go directly to [[Starting the Adventure]].

## How does GameThrough work?
*GameThrough* divides the adventure’s content into encounters and scenes. The difference between encounters and scenes is only from the point of view of the story. In the encounters, a concrete situation is resolved - for example, a battle or an investigation - while the scenes describe more open-ended situations, such as exploring a city. Encounters and scenes are linked depending on players’ decisions. In the bottom left you will always find the *GameThrough* menu.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/summary/gamethrough.jpg&quot; class=&quot;icons-center&quot;&gt;

### Encounters and Scenes
On the left, you will have three tabs (At a glance, Body, Conclusion) and the icons with illustrations, maps, enemies and music.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/summary/gamethrough-2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;icons-center&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* **At a  glance**, describes what the characters can see in the encounter, using their skills.

* **Body**, is the default tab with links to illustrations, enemies, maps and music.

* **Conclusion**, describes the consequences of the characters’ actions. 

* On the right, you will find the text for the encounter or scene. 

### GameThrough Bar
The *GameThrough* bar offers four indexes so you can move around in the adventure. Each index corresponds to one of the following icons:
&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-1.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to the adventure’s classic index.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-2.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to a map with all the adventure’s locations &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-3.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to a list of all the non-player characters relevant to the adventure. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-4.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to a time diagram of the adventure. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-izquierda.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-derecha.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; With these icons, you will be able to navigate around the encounters you have already visited. &lt;/div&gt;

### Indexed rules
All the rules you need to resolve the adventure’s situations will appear on the left-hand side of the screen when you click on one of the [red links](#) or on *italics*. 

## ABOUT US

# STARTING THE ADVENTURE

The characters are hired in the coastal town of Mirador to guard a
caravan that is setting out on a long journey to the cold north. The
caravan intends to conduct its usual trade along the route, but it is
also transporting a young eastern woman, Kikuko Yoki. Kikuko has never
known her heritage, as her parents died when she was young, but an old
family heirloom that had been kept in trust for her until she came of
age has revealed that the ruined town of Saltcrest over 500 miles to the
north might contain information about family in her parents&#39; eastern
homeland.

The caravan comprises four covered wagons, each drawn by a pair of draft
horses. One of the wagons carries supplies for the journey, two carry
trade goods, and one carries passengers. Cusp Redfoot, the gnome
merchant and caravan master, drives one caravan, and his employees
Dreki, Gelden, and Aldo drive the others.

The journey to Saltcrest is due to take around 20 days, and each PC is
offered the going rate for caravan guards along this route of 3 gold
pieces per day there and back.

# Set Up
* 2-3 *Ogres*  

The &quot;giant&quot; tracks lead off road where the caravan wagons cannot
traverse but they can be followed by PCs on foot or horseback with a DC
13 *Wisdom* (Survival) check. Most of the daylight passes before the PCs
arrive. If the Survival check to follow the tracks equals 18 or more,
the PCs arrive in the late afternoon, otherwise, they arrive at dusk.

&gt; Nestled in the side of a hill, concealed by several clumps of trees, is
a large cave. Just outside it is a large bonfire. Most of the wood on
the bonfire has burned down to a glowing bed of red-hot coals, and a low
corona of flames which throw flickering shadows. The wood smoke fails to
mask a sickly sweet smell of sweat and blood. Just inside the cave is
what appears to be a crude wooden enclosure.

The campfire sheds light like a torch. The low vegetation is
undergrowth, and the trees provide light obscurement. The wooden
enclosure stands five feet high, and is more of a pen than a cage. The
ogres often keep stolen cows, sheep, and pigs here before devouring
them. This same pen is where they also keep captive humans, with their
wrists and ankles bound. A large rock keeps the swinging gate closed.
The simple construction notwithstanding, the enclosure is sturdy.
Sitting along the southern wall of the cave are a number of crates and
barrels stolen from the caravan. The ogres have only inventoried a few
of them so far.

## The family
Three *ogres*, Fraegrim, Hogrella, and their son
Picklecheeks, dwell in this cave. This incestuous family attacked the
Villani caravan and now hold Estella and Davrioz Villani, and their
hired caravan guard Garvantos, captive in their pen. All of the
prisoners have their wrists and ankles bound together with ropes, and
dirty rags shoved in their mouths to keep them quiet.

Currently, only Fraegrim and Hogrella are present. The ogres are
distracted, but their greatclubs and javelins remain within reach. The
pair discovered a collection of cooking spices in their stolen loot, and
they are arguing about which to use on Garvantos tonight. Once a fight
starts, one of the pair might scoop up a barrel of beer and hurl it on
the campfire, which extinguishes the fire when it shatters and plunges
the area into darkness. If a greater challenge is required, Picklecheeks
can arrive back from the woods behind the party after combat has
started.



### Treasure
Inside a sturdy wooden keg that has had its lid nailed
back on, the ogre family has poured all the riches they’ve stolen from
travelers over the years. It includes 12 pp, 1,422 gp, a *potion of
remove curse*, and a plain scroll case which contains a *scroll of
stinking cloud*. If Picklecheeks was also killed, there is an additional
4 pp, 50 gp, a *potion of levitate*, and a *potion of enlarge/reduce*.

## Tactics
If the Villanis and Garvantos are rescued they are
incredibly grateful. Davrioz is ashamed he has no riches to bestow upon
the PCs, as much of his fortune was invested in the caravan. Estella
hugs and kisses everyone present if they allow, her eyes wet with tears
of relief. If they are reunited with Ayesha, they are overjoyed. They
ask to take their surviving wagon and as much of their supplies that
survived and head south. There they intend to find some community to
settle down in permanently, and abandon the traditional nomadic
lifestyle.

Aeysha, however, wants none of this. The young woman understands her
parents have grown old, but she dreads the idea of staying put in some
town or village until some farmer sees fit to marry her. Inspired by the
courage and determination of the PCs, she decides she would rather see
the world and have adventures. Her parents resist initially, but do not
stand in her way when she requests to join the PCs&#39; caravan. Aeysha can
fulfill a number of different roles in the caravan, and has been
training to become a fortune-teller. Alternatively, Aeysha can become
the apprentice or cohort of a PC or even the basis for a new PC.

AT A GLANCE
---
* *Detect magic*:
 * There is nothing magical. 
* *Detect evil and good*:
 * There are not aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead creatures.
 * There are not places or objects that has been magically consecrated or desecrated. 

CONCLUSION
---
* On the sixth night way, Ranulfr will attack the caravan at [[The Fate of the White Wolf]].

(Bear in mind the *Days Traveled and Story Events*).

# C1. THE WOLVINGTON GATE
* *Guards*  
* *Sheriff Burniss*  

&gt; The road forks to the east and leads towards a tall, wooden stockade
wall which encircles a settlement. The side road leads to a pair of
large double doors which form a gate through which a caravan can enter.
A large red crystalline stone is attached to a chain and hangs above the
gate, the chain disappearing through a small hole in the wall. Directly
above the gate is a covered *Guard* post and additional guard posts are
set on the wall to either side.

The walls that surround Wolvington are 15 feet high and require a
successful DC 21 *Strength* (Athletics) check to scale. The wall is only
manned, near the east and west gates. The east gate is usually only
opened in emergencies, and all caravan traffic is rerouted to the other
side.

The *plague stone* hangs 10 feet from the ground on a chain, and is
lowered into place from a small trapdoor on the walkway above.

*Sheriff Burniss* typically mans the gate from the ground
at the busiest times of day. This enables him to keep track of who&#39;s in
town, and to single out local farmers to extort. Burniss doesn’t demand
much from the farmers—usually only a few pieces of silver—but this
accumulates quickly. He extorts much more from the families who have a
history of the plague. Those who balk at paying he threatens with a
damning public revelation of their history of the plague (real or
fictitious).

While Hortus Ulby knows the truth, most of the town does not. Anyone
thought to be a plague carrier faces being ostracized, their goods and
custom refused, turned away at the town’s gate, or run out of town.
Burniss prefers to prey on locals who are dependent upon the town. He is
not likely to trouble the PCs provided they look and act as if they are
just in town to do business. The men and women of the town *Guard* are not
part of his scheme, as *Sheriff Burniss* is loath to share the stone’s
secret.

It is difficult to trick the Sheriff and he keeps the *Guards* alert and
disciplined. Attempts to bluff or otherwise distract any of the guards
should be contested by a *Wisdom* (Insight) roll by the Sheriff himself.
The Sheriff takes a late afternoon lunch at the local tavern, however,
which takes around an hour and a half. This can be discovered with a
successful DC 12 *Charisma* check to gather information on the Sheriff&#39;s
movements, or by observing him at the correct time. While the Sheriff is
gone, the guards become much more relaxed. They are unaccustomed to any
true threat at the town’s gate and take the community’s safety and
security for granted. Consequently, you may allow the PCs to gain an
advantage through roleplaying, and/or *Charisma* (Deception or Persuasion)
checks to engage them in conversation and otherwise distract them. For
example, they often man the walls in four shifts. With the Sheriff
elsewhere, they could be persuaded to leave their posts for only a
moment to flirt with admirers, respond to staged disturbances nearby, or
accept a hot drink or cool ale, depending on the prevailing weather.





## Tactics
There is significant risk involved in the theft of the
stone from the gate in broad daylight. If it goes poorly or is
mishandled, the party runs the risk of being run out of town and
isolated from their caravan if it is parked inside. Worse, if the PCs
are associated with the caravan, it could be impounded. If the caravan
is outside of town when these hijinks take place, it can still enter if
the PCs are not known to be members of it.

If the PCs decide that Hortus is a troublemaker, despite his appeal and
forthright explanation, they might simply report the plot to Sheriff
Burniss. In such a case, Burniss gives them a 50 gp reward, and grants
them access to the town to trade, and to refurbish their caravan before
they continue on their way (something he encourages them to do as soon
as possible to avoid a confrontation). He asks them not to discuss the
matter further, and in return treats this information as if it came from
an “anonymous source”.

## Wolvington Town Jail

Wolvington locks its gates at night and *Sheriff Burniss* takes the
*plague stone* to the town jail where it is secured until morning. The
Sheriff is off-duty at night and resides in personal quarters inside the
jail itself. If the PCs choose to break into the jail to steal the
stone, this approach significantly reduces the risk of casual
observation by witnesses. The disadvantage is that it may be difficult
to leave town until daybreak.

The jail is only intended to house town drunks, pick-pockets, and other
minor criminals. Serious criminals are either sent to the major
city-state to the south for trial, or dealt more immediate justice from
the town council (only in the case of situations deemed too dangerous
for delay). Consequently it is not unheard of for the jail to be
unmanned during certain times of the day unless there are prisoners who
merit close supervision. A few town *Guards* are found here just prior to
dawn, midday, and dusk as they prepare to change shifts. The Sheriff is
out most of the day except for a check-in at midday, and nightfall when
he secures the stone. He spends a few hours at the tavern and is then
inside the jail till morning.

Physically the jail is a solid structure in good repair. The walls and
floors are wooden, and the doors are strong wooden doors. All of the
rooms are kept locked. The Sheriff and the Wolvington Town *Guards* all
carry a key on a ring attached to their belts, which unlocks every door
and cell, except rooms **C4**, **C6**, and the Sheriff’s desk. Those two
rooms and the desk have different locks, the keys to which only Sheriff
Burniss carries. Most areas have a hanging light oil lamp except where
noted, which may or may not be lit, depending on whether the guards or
the Sheriff are in the building.

# C2. JAIL ENTRANCE

&gt; This L-shaped room appears to be an office, with wood plank floors and
white-washed walls. A plain desk and chair sit in the west corner. In
the southern end of the room is a larger chair and desk with a handful
of papers, an inkpot, paperweight, and quill. Behind the southern desk
is a heavy-duty, wooden locker. Sturdy double doors are set in the north
and south walls. A single door is set in the wall to the west behind the
smaller desk.

All the doors in and out of this room are routinely kept locked and
require a successful DC 20 *Dexterity* check with *Thieve&#39;s Tools* to
unlock. The smaller desk to the west is for *Guards* to use as necessary,
and is more often than not just a spot to lounge behind during meetings,
assignments, or slow periods.

The Sheriff’s desk is locked and requires a successful DC 25 *Dexterity*
check with *Thieve&#39;s Tools* to unlock (it can be opened by the same key
that opens area **C4** and **C6**). The contents are mostly
unremarkable. A successful DC 12 *Intelligence* (Investigation) check
confirms that Burniss is actually qualified and competent at his job.
His papers detail work assignments, a budget from the Town Council,
payroll, and necessary repairs to the town’s public facilities. A simple
logbook details noteworthy events from recent months, yet the majority
of the entries are still mundane by an adventurer’s standards. Anyone
who examines the logbook thoroughly uncovers a list of names entitled
“Known carriers—approach with caution.” The list names individuals who
may have suffered the plague of 40 years ago, or was related to someone
who did. A PC who does some follow-up detective work in the community
can confirm the list has several older Wolvington families on it with a
successful DC 15 *Charisma* check to gather information.

The locker against the south wall is closed and locked, and requires a
successful DC 15 *Dexterity* check with *Thieve&#39;s Tools* to open. Inside are
3 light crossbows, 8 cases of 10 crossbow bolts, and 6 pairs of manacles
and leg-irons.

## Treasure
A locked desk drawer contains 10 silvered crossbow bolts.

# C3. HALLWAY

&gt; This simple hallway runs east and west. The west end widens to
accommodate a large table against the south wall and a single door that
leads north. The east end is narrower, with two sets of double doors
leading north and south, and another door which goes east and outside.

This is a simple hallway with a couple of special features. The large
table on the west side is often covered with dishes from the local
tavern. The jail has no means to prepare food, so simple meals of gruel
and bread are brought over from the tavern through the east door and
placed here. All the doors are routinely kept locked, except when meals
are served. A successful DC 20 *Dexterity* check with *Thieve&#39;s Tools* opens
them all except the door to **C4**, which requires a successful DC 25
*Dexterity* check with *Thieve&#39;s Tools*.

Due to a flaw in the jail construction, the wooden floors are
particularly creaky here between the double doors. A creature that walks
through this square creates a loud creak which is heard in rooms **C2**
and **C4** with a successful DC 15 *Wisdom* (Perception) check, even when
their doors are closed. A character that actively checks the floor can
notice the loose boards with a successful DC 20 *Wisdom* (Perception)
check. Once a creature is aware of the loose boards they can move
through the square at half speed without causing the creak.

# C4. SHERIFF’S QUARTERS

&gt; This room is someone’s personal quarters, as evidenced by a medium sized
bed, chest of drawers, a small table and foot locker. A set of double
doors exits to the north.

The footlocker is locked and requires a DC 22 *Dexterity* check with
*Thieve&#39;s Tools* to open, or the same key that opens the doors to **C4**
and **C6**.

*Sheriff Burniss* can be found in this room after nightfall.
While he doesn’t retire early, by 11 o’clock he beds down for the night.
His armor, cloak, and other items can be found on top of the small
table. His sword and loaded crossbow are readily available at his
bedside if there is a disturbance.

If Burniss hears a disturbance in the jail, he gets out of bed quietly
and readies a weapon and cloak. He’ll then assess the situation. He may
try to ambush someone coming in the room, quietly investigate, or elect
to don his armor (which takes 1 minute).

If cornered, Burniss fights ferociously to the death. If granted any
means to move towards a more open area, he takes it, while yelling for
help as loud as he can. If reduced to half hit points, he aims to get
outside and summon his town *Guard* and townsfolk.

## Treasure
The Sheriff’s footlocker contains a sack with 400 gp and 2
vials of potions of healing (2d4+2 hit points). This is a portion of the
wealth that Burniss has extorted from local families. This portion he
keeps on hand for personal spending money, and sometimes even to pay his
*Guards*, offer rewards, or pay for information from informants. He keeps
the rest secured in the armory in area **C6.**

# C5. JAIL

&gt; Three cells, comprised of iron bars built into the walls and floors with
a single door, line the west wall. Inside each cell, straw pallets serve
as the only furniture. On the east wall are two doors; the northernmost
is wood, but the southernmost is iron. The words ‘Sheriff Only’ are
painted on the metal door’s surface in Common. Another door is set in
the southern wall of the room.

As mentioned elsewhere, all of the doors and cells are kept locked and
all of them, except the iron door, have an identical lock whose key is
carried by all of the town *Guards* and the Sheriff. The doors can be
opened with a successful DC 20 *Dexterity* check with *Thieve&#39;s Tools*,
except the iron door whose lock is DC 25.

During the day this area is lit by a single *continual flame* torch
mounted on the east wall between the two doors. At night, the torch is
covered with a heavy cloth to make the area dark. This prevents the
prisoners from trying to knock down an oil lamp to set the jail on fire,
or otherwise distract the *Guards*.

### Creatures
The cells are occupied by three people: Oswin Grady,
Mikel Greentoes, and Loupin Cartwright. Oswin is in for pickpocketing,
Mikel for public drunkenness, and Loupin for window peeping.

While the trio are not a threat, they can be an obstacle. If the PCs
enter the area, the prisoners become curious and demand to know what the
PCs are doing—especially if they start to open the iron door. To curry
favor with *Sheriff Burniss*, and in hopes of an early release from jail,
they threaten to yell for attention. There are ways to prevent this,
however, such as releasing them, cowing each of them with a successful
DC 13 *Charisma* (Intimidation) check, or rendering them unconscious
before they can do so. Diplomacy is less effective than normal, as they
have no real incentive to help the party if they receive nothing in
exchange, and thus attempts to persuade them receive a −5 penalty. A
successful *Charisma* (Deception) check can trick them into expecting a
favor or release once the PCs are finished. They know little about what
is behind the iron door except the *plague stone*, and some sets of
armor and weapons. The trap inside **C6** is not evident from across the
room, and Burniss is secretive when he opens and enters that area. All
three share the same opinion of the Sheriff—a competent lawman who has
his own corrupt nature.

### Story Award
There should be no need to fight the prisoners, but
they can complicate matters. If the PCs keep them from interfering with
their plans, grant the party 50 XP each so long as the jail is occupied
with Burniss and/or *Guards*!

# C6. VAULT

&gt; This spacious room contains an armor rack, a weapon rack, and a small
chest. A single iron door on the west wall provides the only entrance
and exit.\\

The lock to the iron vault door requires a DC 25 *Dexterity* check using
*Thieve&#39;s Tools*, or the key that *Sheriff Burniss* carries on his person.
Within this room the Sheriff houses the *plague stone,* some of his
ill-gotten gold, and spare sets of armor and weapons which he issues to
the town guard. He does not permit any of the townspeople in his employ
access to this room, even though the armory is technically a town
resource. There is an unlocked wooden chest here with the rest of the
Sheriff’s personal hoard of gold as well as the *plague stone*.

## Trap
Concealed against the ceiling is a trap in the form of heavy
half-moon bladed axe plated with silver. When the door is opened, the
axe is released to swing down and bury itself in the gut of the
unfortunate character who opened the door. The axe attacks the person
opening the door with a +10 melee attack that deals 1d12+4 slashing
damage. A small button, concealed along the door’s jamb which allows the
door to be opened without danger or the need to reset the trap, can be
found with a successful DC 25 *Wisdom* (Perception) check by someone
actively searching the door.

## Treasure
The armor rack contains 5 sets of half-plate armor, and
the weapons rack holds 5 spears, 5 flails, and 5 heavy crossbows. The
trap itself may be dismantled and a silvered greataxe taken from its
components. Inside the chest are 280 gp, 22 pp, and the *plague stone*.


## Ramifications of the Theft
If the party successfully obtains the *plague stone* and arrives at the
meeting point south of Wolvington, they are met by Hotus&#39;s grandson, a
young man named Trevis, who instructs them to wait while he fetches his
grandfather for the exchange. When he returns it is in the company of 20
men and women from the surrounding farms and properties. Hortus asks for
the *plague stone* and in return pays the party the agreed upon 500 gp.
If the party asks to keep the stone, Hortus motions for them to hand it
over and says, “After I’m finished with it, you can keep the damned
thing.” Hortus explains he and his group is going to confront the
Sheriff in front of the whole town, and that he is responsible for what
happens next. The party is welcome to come to help demonstrate a show of
force, or they can watch from the side, or just depart on their way. In
any case, their obligation is now over. Hortus intends to show the town
the *plague stone*, and make it plain that he arranged its theft. He
promises that any repercussions from the theft won’t fall on them.

If the party confesses that they killed anyone in the process of
obtaining the stone, Hortus is grim and a hush falls upon the assembled
group with him. Someone from the community asks Hortus, “I thought you
said no one would get hurt?” Hortus hushes that individual, but is
plainly downcast. “There was always a chance.” He peers at the PCs, “I
take responsibility for this, but it would be best you folks went about
your way now.”

Hortus is true to his word. He and his group march together to the gates
of Wolvington, and brush past the startled *Guards* who are too taken
aback to turn away people they recognize as friends and neighbors.
Unless *Sheriff Burniss* was inadvertently killed, he is alerted to the
theft by now and emerges to confront Hortus and the mob directly. He
demands to know what is going on.

What proceeds is a confrontation, during which Hortus tells the
astonished townsfolk that the *plague stone* is a fake and always has
been. Burniss tries to deny it, but Hortus knows a little magic and
aptly demonstrates that anyone with the secret can make the stone glow
whenever they want.

&gt; “Forty years ago this town was tearing itself apart. We had zealots and
inquisitors turning neighbor against neighbor. The people of Wolvington
were always able to keep their secrets and sort their own problems out,
but we just needed a reminder. Our old Sheriff gave us something we
could believe in, a magical jewel that told us that everything was
alright and that the plague was gone. With some help from some cooler
minds down south, we restored order for generations. Yet, we have lived
in fear of a problem we could always control ourselves and we put our
faith in a lie.” The old man hefts the glowing stone in one fist. “The
time for lies is over. *Sheriff Burniss* here has turned our fear and our
comfortable lies into a means to get rich off our hard work. It wasn’t
for this abuse of power we made him Sheriff. It’s high time we went back
to the old ways of looking after this community. By watching out for
your neighbors when they need help, and minding our own business when
they don’t.” The old man fixes Burniss with a steely glare. “Your
services are no longer required here Burniss. Get your things and get
gone! We want you out of this town by sundown.”

A simple resolution at this point is for Burniss to sulkily collect his
belongings and leave town, followed by a watchful group of townsfolk. If
you want to get the PCs into the action as the final heroes of the day,
however, Burniss may fly into a rage and attack Hortus. The PCs can
capture, arrest, and secure Burniss in his own jail if they don&#39;t kill
him outright. If incarcerated, the town sends him south to the major
city-state for a quiet trial, after which he is never heard from again.

Much of the gold Burniss kept in the jail was extorted not only from
locals wanting through the gate, but from long-standing families who
were once known to have a plague carrier in their family. While the gold
technically belongs to them, no one steps forward to claim it. Hortus
reckons they would rather have their privacy and security than actually
come forward to make a claim. If the PCs put themselves forward, no one
objects if they take the money as an additional reward.

## Other Business
Aside from the *plague stone* and the Sheriff, Wolvington is an
excellent place to resolve other business. The PCs can buy and sell
trade goods, put in for repairs, and even purchase new wagons and items.

The party may even wish to follow-up on rumors about the mysterious
bandit lord alluded to in Camford.

## Bandit Rumors in Wolvington
PCs who wish to learn more about the bandits, or are just curious about
local news as it pertains to their journey can make a *Charisma* check to
gather information.

* **DC 10** The White Wolf, a notorious bandit lord, is definitely abroad
in this part of the Gypsy Nation. Travelers from the north report
caravans have been attacked. He rarely comes this far south, but his
reach has expanded and his bands sometimes attack travelers on both
sides of the Lantern River.  
* **DC 15** Some believe the White Wolf is a ghost or an evil spirit,
because this is not the first bandit lord to stalk the Gnarlwood area to
go by that name.  
* **DC 20** The White Wolf’s behavior, strategy, and tactics are the same
as those of 25 years ago.  
* **DC 25** The White Wolf’s bandits always steal valuables and often take prisoners. They take the hardiest captives prisoner and let the rest go.
Some report they study each captive’s face carefully, as if looking for
someone specific.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="NPCS" tags="index @main-npcs" position="904,761" size="100,100">

# The Plague Stone
* *Wondrous item*
* This dark, wine-colored crystalline stone is approximately 6 inches in
diameter and has a small metal loop mounted on the back, suitable for it
to be hung by a rope or chain. With a command word, the plague stone
lights up as per *continual flame* with a bright ruby color which can be
seen plainly even in daylight; the same word dismisses the *continual
flame*. Detect magic reveals a divination aura, but the plague stone has
no actual divination properties.
