<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="helm-of-telepathy">Helm of Telepathy</h1>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em> </p>
<p>While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/detect_thoughts/index.html">Detect Thoughts</a></em></strong> spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply--using a bonus action to do so--while your focus on it continues.  <br/>
While focusing on a creature with <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/detect_thoughts/index.html">Detect Thoughts</a></em></strong>, you can use an action to cast the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/suggestion/index.html">Suggestion</a></em></strong> spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/suggestion/index.html">Suggestion</a></em></strong> property can't be used again until the next dawn. </p></div>
