<p>When this power is manifested, the subject can choose to spend its most recently gained <a href="SRD_Skill_Points.html" title="SRD:Skill Points" class="mw-redirect">skill points</a> differently (picking new skills and abandoning old ones if it chooses) and to choose a different <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> from the one it selected when advancing from its previous level to its current level.
</p><p>The subject can also choose to forget <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> it acquired when advancing to its current level, replacing them with new ones.
</p><p>The subject can undo decisions of these sorts that were made at lower levels, if both the subject and the manifester agree to pay the necessary XP before this power is manifested (see below). The subject must abide by the standard rules for selecting skills and <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a>, and so it cannot take <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a> for which it doesnâ€™t qualify or take crossclass skills as <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> skills.
</p><p><i>XP Cost: </i>This power costs 50 XP to manifest to reformat choices made when the character reached her current level. For each additional previous level into which the revision reaches, the power costs an additional 50 XP. The manifester and subject split all XP costs evenly.
