<p><em>2nd-level Divination</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p>You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/alarm/index.html">Alarm</a></em></strong> spell, a <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/glyph_of_warding/index.html">Glyph of Warding</a></em></strong>, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.  <br/>
This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense. </p></div>
