<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Alter_Reality">Alter Reality</span></h2>
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b> <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Cha</a> 29.
</p><p><b>Benefit:</b> This ability is similar to the <i><a href="SRD_Wish.html" title="SRD:Wish">wish</a> </i>spell. The deity merely thinks of something and then makes it so. Doing this requires at least a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>.
</p><p><b>Notes:</b> The deity can duplicate any spell of 9th level or lower as a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>. The duplicated spell has no material or XP component, and the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> of its <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> (if one is allowed) is 20 + the deity’s rank + the deity’s <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a> modifier. 
</p><p>The deity also can duplicate a spell with any <a href="SRD_Metamagic_Feats.html" title="SRD:Metamagic Feats">metamagic feat</a> (so long as the metamagic <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> is available to characters of 20th level or lower). This use of the ability requires the deity to rest for 1 <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> for each level that the <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> would normally add to the spell. It still takes a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> to use this ability, so there is no point in using the ability to duplicate a quickened spell. 
</p><p>The deity can render a magical or supernatural effect permanent. The rest requirement varies with the effect: 10 minutes per level of the effect times the number of subjects affected, 10 minutes per total <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">Hit Dice</a> of creatures affected, or 10 minutes per 10-foot cube affected. Use the highest applicable value. 
</p><p>The deity can create temporary, nonmagical objects. This works like the <a href="SRD_Create_Object_(Divine_Ability).html" title="SRD:Create Object (Divine Ability)">Create Object</a> ability (including the required rest period), except that the items last one day per rank.
</p><p>The deity also can create permanent nonmagical objects as if using the <a href="SRD_Create_Object_(Divine_Ability).html" title="SRD:Create Object (Divine Ability)">Create Object</a> ability except that all rest requirements are doubled and there is no reduction in rest time for being on an Outer Plane or in the deity’s own realm. 
</p><p>The deity can create temporary magic items or creatures. This works like the <a href="SRD_Divine_Creation_(Divine_Ability).html" title="SRD:Divine Creation (Divine Ability)">Divine Creation</a> ability (including the required rest period), except that the items or creatures created last 1 hour per rank. This ability cannot create permanent magic items or creatures. 
</p><p>The deity can reshape a landscape, creating any type of terrain the deity can imagine. Each 10-foot cube of material to be reshaped requires 1 <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> of effort, and the deity must rest for one day per 10-foot cube shaped after the work is completed.
