<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="stinking-cloud">Stinking Cloud</h1>
<p><em>3rd-level conjuration</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute </p>
<p>You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.  <br/>
Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.  <br/>
A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round. </p></div>
