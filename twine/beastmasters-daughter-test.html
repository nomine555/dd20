## Party Level

This adventure is optimised for a party of four to six adventurers of
Level 3. A different sized party or average level can be accommodated by
adjusting the combat encounters and some suggestions are included.

## Background

The party left Carlin Town and is travelling west along a road whose
only destination is the Aldritch Research Centre and Zoo. To the south
is The Fen, a hostile swamp land.

The research centre and zoo is owned and operated by the Wizard
Aldritch, a very old and powerful mage who is extremely well-connected
politically. His daughter Raven Aldritch runs the day to day operations,
including arrangements for the capture of new specimens.

Raven loves all creatures. Her mother died in childbirth and she was
brought up by her wet nurse who died a few years ago. Her father is
often away on business and when he is around he is very aloof, so she
does not know him well.

The Wizard Aldritch carries out experiments on the more exotic beasts
and creatures captured from the forests and swamps hereabouts.

You can learn more about **Wizard Aldritch** and **Raven Aldritch** in
Appendix B: Non-Player Characters on page 30.

The magical shields that keep the specimens in their enclosures failed
during the recent massive lightning storm and the Research Centre is
over-run with monsters trying to get out. Wizard Aldritch is away and
Raven has to deal with the crisis herself. She is looking for a group of
adventurers to help her solve the problem. She doesn’t want the
specimens killed, simply put back in their enclosures. Her Father has an
amulet that will re-initiate the shields but it’s in his Inner Sanctum
which she is magically barred from entering.

## Timing

This adventure is designed to take less than 6 hours. This can be
reduced to less than 5 hours by eliminating the Capture the Mouther
section. Estimated timing is given for each major section of the
adventure within the text. If your players are happy to run the
adventure over two sessions then ignore this timing section, otherwise
you may wish to keep things moving so as to complete the adventure
within the time you have available.

## The Book &amp; Campaign

What makes this adventure unique is the link with the novel and
campaign. The novel complements play by immersing players into the
setting and story. If the players enjoy this adventure they can play the
entire Black Hand Rising campaign.

The first chapter of the novel is available as a free download.

There are no spoilers in the novel for the adventures.

# Situation

Raven tells the party that the **Gibbering Mouther** is reported to be
in The Fen which is the swamp to the south of the road on which the
party approached the research centre. If the party retraces their steps
on the road to Carlin Town, until the swamp to the south nearly touches
the road, they will find a game trail entering the swamp.

As the party enters the swamp the sun is dimmed by the scraggly overhead
foliage. There is a horrible stench of rotting vegetation and insects
bite at exposed skin. The trail is narrow and boggy and care is needed
not to trip over exposed creepers and roots.

If the party follows the trail looking for tracks, have them make a DC12
Perception check to spot where a humanoid recently crashed through the
underbrush and ran north back up the trail to the road (the way the
party have come). A successful DC12 Survival check will indicate that
the person was running blindly and possibly being chased by a second
creature which has left a slime trail. It appears the slimy creature
gave up the chase when the humanoid arrived at the trail. A DC12 Nature
or History check would reveal that Mouthers sometimes leave slime
trails.

**If the party misses the slime trail:**

If the party fails to spot the tracks you may wish to give them another
chance further down the track. If they still fail to spot the slime
trail then they will continue into the swamp. Roll a d20 for every hour
of travel to see if they encounter a random monster (on a result of 17
or more). Determine the type of encounter using the following table
(1d8):

1-4 **Giant Poisonous Snake** x 3

5-6 **Constrictor Snake** x 4

7 **Gray Ooze** x 2

8 **Phase Spider** x 1


An encounter does not necessarily mean combat. The monster(s) may cross
the path without noticing the party or may notice them but ignore them
at your discretion.

After four hours travelling south the party will reach the edge of the
swamp which is hard up against the cliffs on the southern coast of Hilt
Island. If they make it this far, suggest they retrace their steps.

**Difficulty:-** A party of 4 or more characters should have no
significant difficulty dispatching or capturing any random monsters
encountered.

**If the party finds the slime trail:**

The slime trail heads southeast into the swamp and can be easily
followed on the muddy ground.

After half an hour the ground becomes submerged under about one foot of
water and the slime trail is lost. There is an island straight ahead
which rises about three feet above the murky water. It is approximately
oval and about 60 feet across. It is surrounded on all sides by 30 feet
of murky water, one foot deep. The island has several small trees which
have fallen, or been pushed over, forming a crude shelter.

The **Gibbering Mouther** is hiding at the centre of the island and
watches the party approach from its crude shelter. It remains still, and
blends well with the foliage and fallen trees. It will require a DC25
Perception check to see it without entering the water as it will be
about 60 feet away at that point. Once a character is halfway to the
island the Perception check drops to DC20.

When the first character steps foot on the island the **Gibbering
Mouther** attacks. If the party has not seen it then it will receive a
surprise round before the characters can react. The Mouther will be 30’
from the water’s edge when it attacks.

The objective is to capture the Mouther and it can be subdued with a
melee weapon and rendered unconscious rather than being killed (by
reducing its HP to 0).

If the party are clever enough to use missile weapons to deal with the
Mouther they will still need to render it unconscious using a melee
weapon (such as the flat of a sword or a hammer) unless they can
convince you that their missile weapon can render something unconscious
without killing it.

**Difficulty:-** A party of 4 or more characters should have no
significant difficulty dispatching or capturing the Gibbering Mouther. 3
characters may find it a challenge if they all rush into melee combat
with it. In that situation the Game Master will need to act with
caution.

**Tension &amp; Excitement:-** the Mouther’s special abilities should mean
there is plenty of tension and excitement in this combat.

**If the party does not find the Mouther:**

If they can’t locate the Mouther but bring back something else (a
randomly encountered monster) then they will need to convince Raven that
despite this failure, they can do the job (DC15 persuasion check). If
they fail to convince Raven they will have to go back and find the
Mouther. If this occurs then Raven would send her tracker Seth
(**Commoner**) with them and he will spot the slime trail automatically.
He then leaves them to it.

**If the party killed the Mouther in error:**

They will need to convince Raven that despite this failure that they can
do the job. Have them make a convincing argument and roll a persuasion
check DC15. If they pass then provide the agreed reward. If they fail
then she is annoyed and provides no reward. Although she feels that they
have not met the demands of the task, she has limited options and at
least knows they are able to handle themselves in combat so reluctantly
accepts their help anyway with the main task. Raven leads the party to
the Holding Room (location 1 below).

**If the party brings the unconscious Mouther to Raven:**

When the party returns to the Research Centre Raven will congratulate
them and produces the 100gp reward (or whatever was agreed). She leads
them to the Holding Room (location 1 below).

# Handler’s Room

This room provides access to all of the specimen enclosures and from the
human sized tools and gear on the walls looks like it might have been
used by the specimen handlers for feeding and enclosure maintenance.

Each of the four specimen enclosures can be accessed via its own 5’
opening. Next to each opening is a control pedestal for each enclosure.
Each pedestal has three silver buttons.

There is a corridor to the north and one to the east.

A large creature enters the room from the northern corridor. It has the
body of a large bear and the head of a massive owl. Roll for initiative.

The creature is an **Owlbear**. It is hiding from the Hydra and has
survived on the dead cows in location 16.

Remember that Raven asked the party to re-capture the specimens and that
if the party kills any specimens they will forfeit the magic items as
reward (but will still receive gold). The party should be able to
capture the Owlbear using non-lethal damage in a similar way to
capturing the Mouther earlier in the adventure. If the Owlbear is killed
but the Hydra is captured then Raven can be persuaded to still provide
the magic items with a DC15 Persuasion check.

Most of the handlers that would normally be here, monitoring the
specimens, were all killed at location 3.

If the shields have been re-initialised at Shield Control (location 9)
then pressing each button activates / deactivates one shield as
described under the heading How the Shields Work on page 20. Remember
the top button controls the blue shield that is furthest away – in this
case between the 40’ wide enclosure entrance and the corridor.

# Adventure Conclusion

**Time Elapsed:-** In testing it took the party about 5 hours 10 minutes
to reach this point.

Once the party makes their way back to the Quarantine Room (location 2)
they cannot open the sliding door (between locations 2 and 3) until the
quarantine is removed.

To deactivate the quarantine use the Shield Amulet on the shield
pedestal at location 3. The shield pedestal has a hexagonal slot which
fits the amulet. Turning it anti-clockwise 90 degrees deactivates the
quarantine and everything in the Quarantine Room disappears (except for
Raven), including the green shields.

Deactivating the quarantine enables the silver entry plate next to the
door. The door may now be opened by touching the silver plate.

Raven has waited diligently for the party to return (the guards brought
her food if needed) and she is standing on the far side of the
Quarantine Room.

Once the party has reported to Raven but before they leave the
Quarantine Room:

A magical hologram of the Wizard Aldritch appears in the air. This
appears to be a real-time magic projection (rather than the recorded
holograms you’ve previously seen). A great battle is being fought behind
him between Templite and Edrassan forces. He says, “It’s just as well
that you used the amulet for its intended purpose — now give it to
Raven.”

If the party took anything else from the Inner Sanctum (spell
components, his spell book, etc) then the Wizard makes an incantation
and the items disappear from the party’s possession and appear in the
Wizard’s hands in the hologram. He says, “Mine I think!”

**  
If the party gives the Shield Amulet to Raven:**

The Wizard Aldritch says, “I see now that you were trying to help my
daughter. While you might expect me to be grateful for that, I’m not.
I’m very unhappy that you violated my inner sanctum.” He turns to Raven
and says, “I’ll deal with you, young lady, on my return — but for now
I’m a little busy with the war.” And he disappears.

**If the party decides to keep the Shield Amulet then:**

The Wizard Aldritch says, “Trying to keep my amulet would be very
foolish. Not only will you not receive the reward that my daughter
promised you, but you will become my enemy and that will likely go very
badly for you!”

The party now faces a dilemma. Either hold onto what is potentially a
powerful artefact and make an enemy of the obviously powerful Wizard
Aldritch, or take the reward they’ve earned, receive Raven’s gratitude
and not make an enemy of the wizard.

If they choose to handover the Shield Amulet (the smart decision) then
the Wizard gives the speech above under the section “If the party gives
the Shield Amulet to Raven”. Raven then leads them to the Safe Room
(location 1a), uses the amulet to lower the shield, and gives them the
agreed reward.

If they choose to keep the Shield Amulet then:

The hologram of the Wizard Aldritch makes an incantation and the amulet
disappears from the hands of the party and appears in Wizard Aldritch’s
hands in the hologram. He says, “You have revealed yourselves as
thieves. Be gone!“

The party must leave without any reward for their work. If the party
discusses threatening Raven in order to get their reward you may wish to
indicate to them that this would be an extremely bad idea. Wizard
Aldritch is a very powerful magic user and could probably kill the party
fairly easily if he wished.

If the party ignores this advice and threatens Raven in any way (or if
they obtain their reward and then try to take the Shield Amulet from
Raven) then Wizard Aldritch appears in the flesh to defend her. Roll for
initiative. It is unlikely that the party would survive a full on
battle. You may decide to have Wizard Aldritch render them unconscious
instead. Perhaps this could be a lead in to their next adventure where
they appear in a prison or have been sold into slavery, or they may just
awaken in the forest or swamp (with or without their gear). The options
are endless and I’ll leave the fate of the party in your capable hands.

**Experience**

Every character that completes the adventure earns 300XP.

**Time Elapsed:-** In testing it took the party about 5 hours 30 minutes
to complete the adventure.

what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On
a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its

weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the
ooze is destroyed after dealing damage. The ooze can eat through
2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal in 1 round.

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 16

**Languages** —

**Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP)

**Hold Breath:** The hydra can hold its breath for 1 hour.

**Multiple Heads:** The hydra has three heads. While it has more than
one head, the hydra has advantage on saving throws against being
Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Frightened, Stunned, and knocked
Unconscious. Whenever the hydra takes 25 or more damage in a single
turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the hydra dies. At
the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that died
since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last
turn. The hydra regains 10 hit points for each head regrown in this way.

**Reactive Heads:** For each head the hydra has beyond one, it gets an
extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.

**Wakeful:** While the hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake.

for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is Paralyzed while
Poisoned in this way.

is time.

Actions

**Dagger:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or
range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2 piercing damage.

Personality

Aldritch’s passion is to cross breed monsters that he captures and
studies them in his laboratory. He likes to create new and more powerful
“pets”. They are often matched against each other in the fighting pits
(not at this location) for his entertainment and that of the nobles of
Hilt Island.

**Ideals:** To seek power in all its forms.

**Bonds:** The only things he holds any affection for is his spell book
and his “pets”. His feelings for his daughter are complex but publicly
he treats her like a senior member of staff, nothing more.

**Desires:** To rule Hilt Island, for starters. He enjoys creating
complex puzzles and elaborate challenges for others to solve for his
amusement (or die trying).

**Flaws:** Bloodthirsty and lacks compassion. He’s a bit of a glutton
and likes the finest food and drink. Although he over eats he uses magic
to stop himself getting fat.

**Description:** Shorter than average height, dark hair, thick eyebrows,
a profusion of ear hair, greying beard but no moustache, and a face that
rarely smiles. Difficult to tell his age but he appears to be over fifty
(in reality he is many times that). Wears black robes.

Escape

If Wizard Aldritch is reduced to 50 HP or less then he will use the
Teleport spell to transport Raven and himself to a place of safety. He
will take his Shield Amulet, spell book and any spell components the
party took from his Inner Sanctum with him. Award the party 7,000 XP for
getting the better of Wizard Aldritch. But they will have made a
powerful enemy!

The War

Wizard Aldritch is currently backing the Edrassan’s against the Temple
Empire. Raven does not know this and would be appalled if she found out,
but would still never betray her father.

# Appendix C: Magic Items

Circlet of Blasting

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

While wearing this circlet, you can use an action to cast the scorching
ray spell with it. When you make the spell’s attacks, you do so with an
attack bonus of +5. The circlet can’t be used this way again until the
next dawn.

Cloak of Protection

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while you wear this cloak.

Dust of Disappearance

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is
enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into
the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become
Invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects,
and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. If a creature
affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for
that creature.

Eyes of Minute Seeing

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you can see
much better than normal out to a range of 1 foot. You have advantage on
Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight while searching
an area or studying an object within that range.

Gloves of Missile Snaring

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When
a ranged weapon attack hits you while you’re wearing them, you can use
your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier,
provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you
can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that
hand.

Headband of Wisdom \*

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

Your Wisdom score is 19 while you wear this headband. It has no effect
on you if your Wisdom is already 19 or higher.

Javelin of Lightning

*Weapon (javelin), uncommon*

This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command
word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide
that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in
the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much
damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin
when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the
target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6
lightning damage.

The javelin’s property can’t be used again until the next dawn. In the
meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.

# Appendix D: Unused Monsters

**Game Master Tip:** If you have more than one gaming session available
then you may choose to increase the duration and difficulty of this
adventure by returning one or more of the dead specimens to life. For
example; the petrified Owlbear could join its mate in location 15. Or
there may be a standoff between the Hydra and either the Chimera or
Gorgon at location 12. If you would like to do this then you will need
to be careful not to have a Total Party Kill (TPK) if the party is in
combat with two of these monsters at once. Stats for the Gorgon and
Chimera are included here should you wish to use them.

11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.

**Horns:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:

**Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon head exhales fire in a
15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw, taking 31 (7d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.

Gorgon

*Large monstrosity, unaligned*

**Armor Class** 19 (natural armor)

**Languages** —

**Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP)

**Trampling Charge:** If the gorgon moves at least 20 feet straight
toward a creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn,
that target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked
Prone. If the target is Prone, the gorgon can make one attack with its
hooves against it as a bonus action.

Actions

**Gore:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
18 (2d12 + 5) piercing damage.

**Hooves:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

**Petrifying Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The gorgon exhales petrifying gas
in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target begins to turn to
stone and is Restrained. The Restrained target must repeat the saving
throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the
target. On a failure, the target is Petrified until freed by the greater
restoration spell or other magic.

# The Research Centre

Refer to the Research Centre Map on page 3 for the layout of the
numbered locations.

Here the Wizard Aldritch conducts research cross-breeding all sorts of
monstrosities. His daughter assists with the capture and care of
specimens in addition to her duties running the Zoo and caring for its
inhabitants.

# 1. Holding Room

**Time Elapsed:-** In testing it took the party about 1 hour to reach
this point. This should be considered a guide only. Your party will take
as long as it takes them to get to this point. However, these timing
guidelines are provided for your reference in case you have limited time
for your game. If that is the case you may wish to limit the time the
party spends on tasks you do not consider core to this adventure.

From the main yard the Research Centre is accessed via a large 15’
square door built into the side of a hill to the east. There is a single
**Guard** on duty.

Raven holds her palm to a 6” square silver entry plate which is set into
the wall next to the door. There is a hum and the door magically slides
sideways into the hill. Beyond the door is a warehouse which contains a
number of large empty cages on the north wall as well as feedstock in
sacks and crates along the south wall. Straight ahead on the east wall
is another 15’ square door with a square silver entry plate next to it.

The ceiling has magical lighting panels which Raven explains are
throughout the centre for the convenience of the staff.

Raven tells the party to deposit the Mouther in one of the empty cages.
She then gives it a quick examination and checks its vital signs.
Satisfied that it will regain consciousness in due course she locks it
in the cage and invites the party to sit with her at a wooden table on
the south wall.

Raven looks each party member in the eye. Satisfied with what she sees,
Raven reveals the difficult task ahead:

-   A number of the research specimens are powerful monsters and so are
    confined in their enclosures by magical shields.

-   Some monsters are so large that they barely fit through the 15’
    square doors throughout the centre.

-   A violent lightning storm occurred about a month ago and the
    research centre was hit by lightning multiple times. This caused the
    magical shields restraining the creatures to fail.

-   The research centre was overrun with specimens trying to get out.

-   Wizard Aldritch is away and Raven has to deal with the
    crisis herself. She is looking for a group of adventurers to help
    her solve the problem.

-   She doesn’t want the specimens killed, just put back in their cages.
    This is very important to her.

-   Her Father has an amulet that will re-initiate the shields but it’s
    in his Inner Sanctum (location 8 below) which Raven is magically
    barred from entering.

-   If asked Raven can explain how the shields work (refer to page 20).

-   Raven is prepared to offer the choice of either 1,000gp or a magic
    item for each party member which they may choose from a range of
    items available. With good negotiation the party may be able to
    convince Raven to provide both the items and some of the money
    (DC15 persuasion).

-   If Raven notices a PC with a particular affinity towards her
    animals, or if a party member asks, then she might gift them an
    animal companion as a reward at the end of the adventure. The
    creature should have less than 5HP. Good options include an: Owl,
    Eagle, Frog, Badger, Mastiff, etc.

-   Raven makes it clear that if the party kills specimens they will not
    receive any magic items.

-   If the party asks then Raven will show them the items and money in
    The Safe (location 1a).

-   Raven does not have any information on the current specimens.
    Specimens come and go and she leaves their day to day care
    to others.

-   Raven will describe the basic layout once the party exits the
    quarantine room: “A large 15&#39; wide corridor heads east. Straight
    ahead (east) leads to the Inner Sanctum and to the right (south) are
    the Specimen Enclosures.”

-   She has never been in locations 5-9 (Daddy likes his privacy).

## 1a. The Safe

At the west end of the southern wall of the Holding Room (location 1) is
a heavy iron door. Raven has the key. After opening the safe door a
green magical shield prevents entry to the room beyond although the
party can see through the shield.

The shield can only be lowered with the Shield Amulet from the Inner
Sanctum (location 8). To the left of the door is a round pedestal. Place
the amulet in the hexagonal slot in the top of the pedestal and turn
ninety degrees anti-clockwise (de-activating shields is always
anti-clockwise). The shield will disappear.

A Detect Magic spell will detect the abjuration magic of the shield and
can faintly detect through the shield that a number of the items in the
safe are magical but the shield prevents more detailed information.
There is also 3,000gp worth of coins in various denominations stacked on
shelves.

The safe contains the following magic items:

-   Circlet of Blasting (Bracelet)

-   Cloak of Protection (Cloak)

-   Dust of Disappearance (Pouch)

-   Eyes of Minute Seeing (Crystal Lenses)

-   Gloves of Missile Snaring (Gloves)

-   Headband of Wisdom (Headband)

-   Javelin of Lightning (Javelin)

The party members may each select one magic item once they are
successful.

A DC8 Insight check on Raven will show that she is telling the truth
about the reward and that she will provide it once the party is
successful.


## 2. Quarantine Room

When the party are ready to proceed, Raven places her palm on the silver
entry plate to the right of the door to location 2 and it magically
slides to one side. Whenever a door has a silver entry plate then any
character may open or close the door by placing their palm on the plate.
She accompanies the party into the room.

This room quarantines the Holding Room from the rest of the research
centre.

It is normally a blank room but because of the crisis the magical wards
put in place by the Wizard Aldritch have activated and this room now
quarantines the facility, preventing the creatures from leaving and
making entry a risky process.

From the entry door there is a 10’ gap and then a shimmering transparent
curtain of air with a faint green tinge. The magical green shield has
large magical writing on it: “Research Centre Under Quarantine – Do Not
Enter”.

Beyond the curtain is what looks like a giant chess board with each
square 5’ on a side. At the other end of the board is a second green
shield, then a 10’ gap to the closed 15’ wide exit door. The exit door
has a square silver plate on the wall next to it which you assume may
open the door.

&gt; Stepping through the curtain gives a tingling sensation of magic. The
&gt; first character to step through the curtain and place both feet on a
&gt; square triggers a magical hologram of Wizard Aldritch who says:
&gt;
&gt; “Aaaah, not one to heed warnings aye? Well I see you’ve selected a
&gt; &amp;lt;knight, bishop, rook, king or queen, depending on which square
&gt; they stepped onto&amp;gt;.”
&gt;
&gt; The corresponding piece &amp;lt;knight, bishop, etc&amp;gt; appears directly
&gt; opposite the character. Roll initiative.
&gt;
&gt; If you don’t have access to a chess set then make pieces by writing
&gt; the name of the piece on a 1” square of paper or card.
&gt;
&gt; The hologram then disappears. Although if you wish you may make the
&gt; hologram remain in place and have it taunt the party during the game
&gt; saying things like: “Foolish move” or “Are you trying to get yourself
&gt; killed? Mmmmm?” NB: this is a semi-interactive recording and not
&gt; Wizard Aldritch live.


**Example of How this Room Works**

Say there are 4 party members;

-   Conrad the Cleric

-   Ferd the Fighter

-   Marvin the Mage

-   Deg the Druid

Say Conrad steps through the green magical curtain onto the second
square from the left which would normally be occupied by a Knight in a
game of chess. A Knight appears opposite Conrad as shown below (squares
are 5’):

Door to Research Centre (Location 3)

|     |        |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|-----|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|     |        |     |     |     |     |     |     |

|     |        |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|     |        |     |     |     |     |     |     |

|     |        |     |     |     |     |     |     |

Door to Holding Room (Location 1)

For your reference — Chess pieces that correspond to each square:

| R   | K   | B   | Q   | Kg  | B   | K   | R   |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|

(R=Rook, K=Knight, B=Bishop, Q=Queen, Kg=King)

**Chess Pieces / Moves Explanation**

If you haven’t played chess before here’s a brief explanation of how the
pieces move:

**R = Rook (Castle)** – The rook moves in a straight line either
horizontally or vertically through any number of unoccupied squares,
until it reaches the end of the board or it is blocked by another piece.

**K = Knight (Horse)** — The knight is the only piece on the board that
may jump over other pieces. The knight moves two squares horizontally or
vertically and then one more square at a right-angle. The knight’s move
is always shaped as an “L”.

**B = Bishop** — The bishop moves in a straight line diagonally on the
board. It can move as many squares as wanted, until it meets the end of
the board or another piece.

**Q = Queen** — It can move any number of squares in a straight line —
either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

**Kg = King** — The king can move to any adjacent square. That is, it
can move one square in any direction: horizontally, vertically or
diagonally.

Back to our example: both Conrad and the Knight may only move like a
Knight in a chess game. The Knight will have the stats, abilities,
spells and spell slots of Conrad and his face can be seen dimly on the
stone chess piece.

Record which player spawned which enemy chess piece when they step
through the magical curtain and any key stats you may wish to remember.
You don’t need to write down everything and can ask the players for
their character sheets whenever you wish:

| **Player Name Entered Board** | **Chess Piece They Spawned** | **Chess Piece’s Key Stats ** |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Eg: Conrad the Cleric         | Eg: Knight                   | Eg: HP23 AC16                |
|                               |                              |                              |
|                               |                              |                              |
|                               |                              |                              |
|                               |                              |                              |
|                               |                              |                              |
|                               |                              |                              |

This example is for the Game Master only. The players will have to
figure out the rules of the room for themselves.

**Combat on the Chess Board**

-   Roll Initiative for all players as soon as the first player enters
    the chess board.

-   Each chess piece has the same initiative roll as the player that
    spawned it and will always take their turn after that player. Eg:
    Conrad continues his turn after entering the board and then it’s the
    Knights turn.

-   The player inherits the movement characteristics of the chess piece
    they spawned. Eg: Conrad must move like a Knight does in chess. A
    player may make a move on the chess board after they step through
    the curtain.

-   Players normal movement distance is not used when on the
    chess board. They have the movement of the chess piece they spawned.
    Players may Dash in order to move again in their turn.

-   Players and chess pieces may use missile attacks and spells (if they
    have them) as normal in their turn but missiles and spells cannot
    pass through the green magical curtains in either direction.

-   Players and chess pieces on adjacent squares may make melee attacks
    as normal and normal combat rules apply.

-   An exception to normal combat is that characters and chess pieces
    may not move through squares occupied by other characters or chess
    pieces except for the Knight which jumps over
    intervening players/pieces.

-   No square may have more than one player or piece occupying it
    at once. Ie; characters and pieces may not share a square. Not even
    a Knight may move to an occupied square.

-   If a character falls unconscious on the chess board and all of their
    party members are either unconscious on the chess board, or have
    exited the chess board, then the unconscious player(s) will be
    teleported off the chess board and will appear where they started,
    between the magical green curtain and the door to the Holding Room
    (location 1). Raven Aldritch is waiting there and will use her
    veterinary skills to bring the character back to consciousness
    with 1HP. If this occurs the corresponding chess piece will be
    removed when the character is teleported. If they re-enter the chess
    board then a new piece will spawn depending on the square they enter
    the chess board on.

**Exiting the Chess Board**

When a character exits the chess board by moving through the magical
green curtain towards the Preparation Room (Location 4), the chess piece
they spawned is removed. Eg: when Conrad exits the chess board the
Knight he spawned will disappear. The characters movement immediately
returns to normal.

Once all party members have exited the chess board the exit door unlocks
and the door may then be opened by touching the silver plate on the wall
next to the door. If no party members exit and all fall unconscious on
the chess board then they are all teleported (see Combat on the Chess
Board above).

**The Magical Green Curtains**

Raven Aldritch cannot pass through the magical green curtains. Her
father does not want her in the facility because of the quarantine. She
will remain behind once the party exits this room.

The magical green curtains only allow creatures and objects to move in
one direction ie; they allow creatures to enter the facility but not to
leave.

So once a character has moved through the first green curtain onto the
chess board they cannot go back (unless they fall unconscious and the
chess board teleports them – see above).

Missile weapons and magic cannot pass through the green curtains.

Green curtains cannot be dispelled.

**Representing the Board**

You can draw the room or you can use a chess board.

**Moving to the next location**

Once the door unlocks (see Exiting the Chess Board above) the characters
may open the door and move into the corridor beyond.

**Difficulty:-** This encounter is self-balancing for any sized party.

**Experience**

Every character that makes it across the chess board earns 300XP
regardless of whether they fought the chess pieces or not. Killing the
chess pieces provides no additional experience.



## 3. Other Side of the Quarantine Exit Door

The corridor contains a dozen human bodies. Some have been ripped into
pieces, others burned, and some look like they’ve been turned to stone!
They all wear the remains of khaki uniforms with insignia of the
research centre.

In an alcove on the south wall is a pedestal similar to the one in front
of the Safe (location 1a).

Searching the bodies turns up a few coins totaling 10gp.

This side of the door has a silver entry plate which will not work until
the quarantine is removed by placing the Amulet in the pedestal. See
Adventure Conclusion on page 24 for how the pedestal works.

## 4. Preparation Room

**Time Elapsed:-** In testing it took the party about 2 hours and 15
minutes to reach this point.

A silver plate on the wall opens the door, which is not locked.

This room looks like a cross between an operating theatre and a
laboratory. It has room to work on two specimens at once on large metal
tables.

The Preparation room is where **Wizard Aldritch** works on his
specimens. On metal tables along the walls are medical implements which
look like scalpels, saws, tubes with large needles attached, large
silver spoon devices, and other medical instruments. They are all
oversize and not useful for working on humanoids. Total value 100gp in
the Carlin Town market but Raven would probably not appreciate the party
taking these when they are being so well paid. There is nothing else of
interest to the party in this room. If the party try to sneak these
items out past Raven you could have her make a perception check to catch
them out.

The wooden 5’ door on the east wall is not locked. It is probably the
first 5’ door the party has seen except for the Safe door at location
1a.

## 5. Red Shields

Refer to the map on page 3 for the location of the Red shields. These
Red shields look and feel like stone walls and are indistinguishable
from the rest of the corridor. Anyone holding the Shield Amulet from
location 8 (and anyone touching that person) can see through the shields
into the corridor beyond as if the shields aren’t there. The holder of
the Shield Amulet (and anyone touching them) can walk through the
shields as if they aren’t there.

The shields can be detected with a Detect Magic spell (Abjuration) but
cannot be dispelled.

## 6. Talking Door

The Door to the Cupboards of Doom room (location 7) is a magical talking
door.

The corridor is blocked by a stone door with a carved stone face and the
word “Spawn” (in Common) chiselled into its forehead.

“Hello there,” says the door in a friendly tone of voice.

The door is very friendly and while it would be happy to answer
questions it honestly doesn’t know anything. The doors face can be quite
animated.

The door doesn’t know how to open itself as it has the attention span of
a goldfish and doesn’t remember the last time it was opened. However, if
the door can be made to say the word “Spawn” out loud then the door
opens. When it opens, the door is very surprised and isn’t sure what’s
happening (it doesn’t remember having opened before and the motion is
quite disconcerting for it).

One of the party will probably eventually ask the door why it has a word
on its forehead. The door is unaware of this fact. If they tell the door
it has the word “Spawn” on its forehead, you may like to have the door
repeat what the character said eg: “Really? I have the word Spawn
written on my forehead?” and because the door said “Spawn” out loud the
door will open.

The door has a very faint line around it which is the gap to the
surrounding wall. It has no handle or visible hinges. Brute strength can
be used but the door has 100 HP and is immune to slashing and piercing
damage from non-magical weapons.

As background: When the Wizard Aldritch wishes the door to open he
speaks the password “Doth Kalidus” and the door opens and the
protections in the Cupboards of Doom room are disabled. Of course the
party has no way of knowing this.

Raven has never been past this door as the door has been instructed to
ignore her and anything she may say. Her Father does not want her to
enter. This is simply background as Raven is still in the Quarantine
Room.

**Experience**

If the door is opened or bypassed without smashing it down then each
party member gains 150 XP. If they smash it they receive no experience
as they haven’t learned anything!

## 7. Cupboards of Doom

**Time Elapsed:-** In testing it took the party about 2 hours and 35
minutes to reach this point.

This long room is separated into two halves by a large crevasse (about
13’ wide). There are two doors on this side of the crevasse (one on each
side wall). There are also two doors on the other side of the crevasse
(one on each side wall). There is a door in the centre of the opposite
wall. All doors are 5’ wide and wooden.

The crevasse is 60’ deep and any character falling into it will take 6d6
falling damage.

The 4 doors with 5’ square cupboards behind them are where the undead
spawn. Doors open into the room and automatically close after an undead
creature exits the cupboard.

Once the room is described and the party has a plan to get across the
crevasse, but before they try it, a magical hologram of the Wizard
Aldritch appears in the air over the crevasse and says:

“I’ve been notified that you are trying to gain access to my inner
sanctum. Either you’ll die trying, which I guess is bad for you, or I’ll
be forced to return and deal with you which you’ll find to be infinitely
worse. You have 6 seconds to leave!”

-   Roll for initiative immediately.

-   If the party doesn’t leave in the first round of combat then at the
    beginning of the second round of combat the 4 doors open and undead
    come out.

Each turn of combat a random undead creature comes out of each of the
four doors. Roll 1d6 on the following table four times (roll them all at
once and allocate the undead to the cupboards as you see fit):

1-3 **Skeleton **

4-5 **Zombie**

6 **Ghoul** \*

\* Maximum of one Ghoul arrives per turn. If you roll more than one
Ghoul then replace with a Zombie.

**Difficulty:-** The above assumes a party of 4 player characters. If
the party has 3 characters only roll for 3 of the doors rather than 4.
If the party has 5 or 6 characters then ignore the one Ghoul maximum per
turn.

Ghouls and Zombies will tend to spawn on the side of the crevasse
closest to the Talking Door and will try to enter melee combat with the
party.

Skeletons have bows and short swords so have no preference of spawning
location.

If a zombie or ghoul comes out on the side of the crevasse closest to
the Inner Sanctum, and no characters are on the same side of the
crevasse, then they might attack each other or try to jump the crevasse
to get at the party (50/50 random chance). Zombies and Ghouls have only
just enough strength to try a running jump to get over the crevasse and
so will land right on the edge and will need to make a DC12 Dexterity
Saving Throw to not fall backwards into the crevasse. Zombies will
rarely make it due to their awful dexterity and this can provide some
opportunities for amusing descriptions of undead acrobatics!

This is a battle of attrition. There is an unending supply of undead and
unless the adventurers block the cupboard doors, or jam them shut to
prevent them opening, or cross the crevasse and exit the opposite door,
then they are probably going to be in deep trouble!

Cupboard doors:

-   Are wooden and open into the room so they can be jammed closed with
    a piton, dagger or similar, wedged under the door.

-   It is difficult for the undead trapped in a cupboard with a jammed
    door to break out, due to the confined space, and they will need to
    pass a DC18 strength check to do so.

-   If the party destroy or remove the doors this does not stop new
    undead from spawning.

-   If a character enters a cupboard and an undead spawns next to them
    the undead will try to grapple the character in their turn.

**Jumping**

Characters that wish to jump the crevasse must have Strength of 13 or
better and must move at least 10’ in a straight line before the jump. If
the character has Strength of exactly 13, have them make an Athletics or
Acrobatics check (their choice) on a DC 12. If they fail they fall into
the crevasse and take 6d6 falling damage. Characters with 14 or higher
strength clear the crevasse sufficiently to not require the check.

Pitons can be hammered between the stone floor tiles to anchor a rope.

As background, if the correct password (Doth Kalidus) is spoken to the
Talking Door then the undead are suspended and a magical bridge over the
chasm appears. Of course this won’t happen because the party won’t know
the password. Therefore the room’s defences will be fully active to
protect Wizard Aldritch’s Inner Sanctum regardless of how the party went
through or bypassed the Talking Door.

If the party is having difficulties remind them that they can always
retreat, regroup and try again. If all of the party exit the room
through the Talking Door and close it behind them (by telling the door
to say “spawn” out loud) then the undead will not follow them and will
simply disappear. The room will be reset ready for when the party
return, so if they are being overwhelmed this is a good option.

Undead will not leave this room voluntarily. If they are forced to leave
the room (for example, if a Cleric uses Channel Divinity: Turn Undead)
then they will turn to dust as soon as they leave the room.

**Exit**

The wooden door to the Inner Sanctum is not locked. Once the entire
party exits the room (either into the Inner Sanctum or back through the
Talking Door) the undead will disappear and the room will reset.

**Experience**

In addition to any experience earned for killing undead, characters also
gain 150XP each for gaining access to the Inner Sanctum.

combat, the Ghoul, Skeleton and Zombie stats are repeated together on

## 8. Inner Sanctum

The wooden door to this room is not locked. When the party enters this
room and closes the door the Cupboards of Doom room resets and all
undead disappear.

This large room is the study of the powerful Wizard Aldritch.

This large room is two stories tall with an arched ceiling. The right
half of this room contains floor to ceiling bookshelves with thousands
of books (reached by ladders).

These books cover all manner of topics: history, medicine, religion,
sociology and psychology. These are non-magical texts.

On the left side of the room there is a large desk with three books open
to pictures of three different large monstrous creatures. There is
parchment, a quill and various coloured inks. A half-finished drawing of
a creature is in the centre of the desk. It appears to be a combination
of the three pictures in the three books.

Four large glass cabinets contain all manner of items. They have many
shelves and drawers.

The three books on the desk show pictures of creatures not of this plane
of existence and so the party do not recognise them. Wizard Aldritch is
looking at innovative ways to combine these creatures into a single very
powerful monster.

In the desk drawers are various papers and letters. A DC15 Investigation
check identifies one surprising letter dated several months ago from the
clerk of the Edrassan King Torrent. The letter confirms a meeting in the
Edrassan capital, Astridon. This is a clue that Wizard Aldritch may not
be a loyal Templite.

The glass cabinets contain any spell component a Wizard might require
for all spells of Level 1-9 (including all of those with gold piece
values). Characters can take these and use them during the adventure but
Wizard Aldritch will take them back at the end (see Adventure Conclusion
on page 24).

Along the wall behind the desk there are three items (from left to
right): a pedestal on which sits a heavy leather bound book, a pedestal
on which sits an amulet with a large blue hexagonal gem, and a wooden
rack for holding a large staff (the rack is currently empty).

**Heavy Leather Bound Book**

This book includes fine metal scroll work on the cover. It is a backup
copy of Aldritch’s spell book. He has spent more than one lifetime
collecting spells and studying magic. The book includes all Wizard
spells of Level 1 to 9.

If the book is opened a magical mouth appears above and behind the book
and says in an English accent:

-   “Oi! Now see here. Who the blazes are you?”

-   The book likes to talk and will do so constantly when the book
    is open. It will ask questions such as:

    -   “Who are you then?” and

    -   “What are you doin’ in my guvna’s study?” and

    -   will tell the party they shouldn’t be here.

-   It will not provide any information to the party unless they
    threaten to destroy the book.

-   Closing the book will stop it speaking.

A wizard may copy spells from the book using the normal rules. There are
enough magical inks on the desk to copy 3 spells. Characters can take
the book but Wizard Aldritch will take it back at the end (see Adventure
Conclusion on page 24).

**Blue Shield Amulet**

The blue Shield Amulet is what the party has come to find. It is magical
and controls the shield spells. It is hexagonal in shape and fits:

-   the pedestal outside the Quarantine Room (to remove the quarantine)
    at location 3;

-   the pedestal outside the Safe (location 1a); and

-   the pedestal in the Shield Control Room (location 9) to
    re-initialise the shields in the Specimen Enclosures.

This room is a safe location to take a rest should the party wish to do
so.

**Exit**

The only way out of the Inner Sanctum is back through the Cupboards of
Doom which has been reset and there are no longer any undead in the
room. Have the party roll initiative before they enter the Cupboards of
Doom room from the Inner Sanctum.

At the end of the first round:

The magical hologram of the Wizard Aldritch re-appears in the air over
the crevasse and he says “I see you made it into my private chambers.
Well now you have to get out again. Of course if you succeed then I’ll
have to deal with you myself!”

Undead appear at the beginning of the second round of combat following
the rules specified for location 7.

## 9. Shield Control

This room is protected by the Red Shields (location 5).

This 15’ square stone room is devoid of furniture or decoration except
for a waist height pedestal.

The pedestal in this room is the Shield Control Pedestal. It has a
hexagonal slot in the top. If the party inserts the Shield Amulet into
the slot and turns it clockwise there will be a blue pulse of light, a
loud electrical buzzing and all exposed hair will stand on end for 2
seconds. This action has re-initialised all blue shields in the Specimen
Enclosures (locations 10-15). A blue indicator light is now lit on the
pedestal. The shields will remain down until individually raised from
the control pedestals in the Specimen Enclosures. Unless initialized
here the shields in the Specimen Enclosures will not work.

The Shield Amulet can be removed from the pedestal once the shields are
initialized. Turning the amulet anti-clockwise will disable all blue
shields and turns off the blue indicator light.

# Specimen Enclosures

There are 4 specimen enclosures.

**Game Master Tip:** Build the tension until the party encounter the
Hydra. They might hear the Hydra moving in the distance or chewing on
the Gorgon’s carcass.

## How the Shields Work

Each enclosure has a shield control pedestal at each entrance to the
enclosure. The entrance from the main corridor is 40’ wide while the
entrance from location 15 is 5’ wide.

If the shields have been re-initialised at Shield Control (location 9)
then pressing each button activates / deactivates one shield as follows:

-   The top button controls the blue shield that is furthest away from
    the pedestal ie: if you are using the pedestal at the 40’ wide
    entrance then the shield furthest from you is across the 5’ opening
    at the rear of the enclosure. But if you are at location 15 then the
    shield furthest from you is the 40’ wide shield separating the
    enclosure from the main corridor.

-   The middle button controls the blue shield that bisects the
    enclosure (refer to the map). This is used for containing specimens
    in half the enclosure for cleaning, feeding and
    maintenance purposes.

-   The bottom button controls the blue shield closest to the pedestal.

No creature can pass through a blue shield once activated and shields
completely fill the opening they are designed to block. Ie; you can’t go
over, under or around them. Trying to excavate rock or dig underneath
the shield will not work as the shield will expand to fill the space
created. Shields cannot be dispelled.

Shields will not activate if a specimen is in the way. We can’t have the
specimens cut in half by mistake now can we! The players will need to
figure out why the shield failed to activate.

When shields activate or deactivate, an electric buzzing fills the air
and everyone’s hair stands on end. There is a loud pop and a blue
magical shield appears / disappears.

## 10. Specimen Enclosures Entrance

**Time Elapsed:-** In testing it took the party about 4 hours 30 minutes
to reach this point.

The 15’ wide corridor emerges into a giant natural stone cavern.
Straight ahead a massive stalagmite rises up towards the roof more than
100’ above. The stalagmite is circular, as is the cavern. The roof of
the cavern is luminous and gives off sufficient light so that the entire
cavern is dimly lit.

A 15’ corridor goes around the stalagmite to the left and right.
Straight ahead a 5’ tunnel has been carved into the stalagmite.

You can see two waist high pedestals in the shape of a cylinder which
are about 3’ in diameter each. One is to the left and the other is to
the right. Both are about 25’ away.

The footsteps of a massive creature echo off the walls and then stop.

## Specimen Enclosures Description

When the party first sees an enclosure, describe it as follows (assuming
they are standing in the 15’ wide circular corridor):

The massive stalagmite has been cut away to create a roughly
semi-circular space about 40’ wide and deep. It is an irregular shape
and contains grass, plants, rocks and a shallow pool of water. Obviously
this is a specimen enclosure. At the rear there is a 5’ wide opening
which seems to go deeper into the stalagmite.

In the corridor is a pedestal with a silver plate and 3 silver buttons
(top, middle and bottom buttons).

## 11. Owlbear Enclosure

If this is the first specimen enclosure they have seen then read the
description from the heading Specimen Enclosures Description on page 20.

There is a dead creature in the corridor which has the body of a large
bear and the head of a massive owl. It has been turned to stone.

The creature is an Owlbear. It is the mate of the Owlbear in area 15. It
was Petrified by the Gorgon when the shields failed. It can be freed by
the Greater Restoration spell.

## 12. Gorgon Enclosure

This description assumes the party are standing in the 15’ wide circular
corridor:

Squatting next to a waist high pedestal is a man dressed in the ragged
remains of a handler’s khaki uniform. About 30’ beyond him is a dead
creature – the top half is a large humanoid (the size of an ogre) and
the lower half is a large serpent. The creature has been half devoured
and in fact there is currently a massive monster chomping on one of its
arms. This massive creature has 3 heads, although it looks like at one
point it had 5. The two necks that used to have heads have been
cauterised. Both the dead creature and the live one are in the corridor.

One head is chewing on the dead creature while the other two heads
appear to be asleep.

The handler sees you enter the corridor and his eyes go wide with the
hope of rescue. He stands up and runs toward you shouting, “Help me,
please help me!” The monstrous creature’s heads whip around and it
charges towards the man who is running towards the party. Roll for
initiative.

The handler is a human **Commoner** and he is 25’ away. In his weakened
state he can dash 20’ per turn. His name is Lash and he has been living
off scraps and water in the enclosures for the past month. He has been
driven crazy by constant fear and won’t necessarily behave rationally.
His only motivation is to escape.

The dead creature was a Gorgon. The living creature chomping on it is a
**Hydra** which is 30’ from Lash and 55’ from the party.

The **Hydra** has taken damage from the other creatures it fought when
the shields failed and the flame damage it has received could not be
healed. The party may decide to try and lure it into an enclosure and
seal it in, fight it or run away. The entrances to location 15 are only
5’ wide and the Hydra is too large to follow, although its heads can
attack into the first 10’ of the corridor / area.

The Hydra is looking for fresh food and although it was Lash’s shout and
movement that attracted its attention, it will attack the party as soon
as Lash is dead or if the party attack.

Remember that Raven asked the party to re-capture the specimens and that
if the party kills any specimens they will forfeit the magic items as
reward (but will still receive gold). The Hydra, along with the Owlbear
in location 15, are the only specimens left alive and capturing them
will provide the magic items reward from Raven. When the shields failed
the specimens fought and killed each other which is not the parties
fault and Raven will understand.

**Example of trapping the Hydra:**

If the party can lure the Hydra into an enclosure then they can trap it
using the shields, either from the corridor control pedestal or from the
handler’s room control pedestal, for that enclosure.

The Hydra will charge after any people or food it sees.

For example, if the party is at location 15 and the Hydra is at location
12 they could taunt the Hydra through the 5’ opening to the enclosure
from the Handler’s Room. The Hydra would charge towards them and would
then be in the enclosure itself (draw a line between location 12 and
location 15 to see the path the Hydra may take). The Hydra is too big to
fit through the 5’ opening, although its heads could attack through it
to a distance of 10’. However, once the Hydra is in the enclosure it
should be a simple task for the party to use the adjacent shield control
pedestal to raise the shields, trapping the Hydra (refer to the heading
‘How the Shields Work’ page 20).

Alternatively they could do something clever with the cows in the Larder
(location 16) to tempt the **Hydra**.

**Difficulty:-** The above assumes a party of 4 player characters (level
3). If the party has 3 reduce the **Hydra** to 85 HP. If the party has 5
characters increase to 125 HP. For 6 characters give it 140 HP and 4
heads.

**Tension &amp; Excitement:-** it is important that the party doesn’t trap
the **Hydra** too easily. It should be a tense situation where the
perceived consequences of failure should be dire!

Once the party has contained the **Hydra** behind a shield, or killed
it, (and assuming they’ve dealt with the Owlbear at location 15 already)
then they have achieved the objective set by Raven Aldritch and may
return to location 2 to claim their reward (see Adventure Conclusion on
page 24).

## 13. Hydra Enclosure

This empty enclosure used to hold the Hydra.

## 14. Chimera Enclosure

If this is the first specimen enclosure they have seen then read the
description from the heading Specimen Enclosures Description on page 20.

This enclosure contains a large dead creature with the body and head of
a lion but with two additional heads, one a serpent and the other a
goat. The creature had wings.

The dead creature was a Chimera.

## 15. Handler’s Room

This room provides access to all of the specimen enclosures and from the
human sized tools and gear on the walls looks like it might have been
used by the specimen handlers for feeding and enclosure maintenance.

Each of the four specimen enclosures can be accessed via its own 5’
opening. Next to each opening is a control pedestal for each enclosure.
Each pedestal has three silver buttons.

There is a corridor to the north and one to the east.

A large creature enters the room from the northern corridor. It has the
body of a large bear and the head of a massive owl. Roll for initiative.

The creature is an **Owlbear**. It is hiding from the Hydra and has
survived on the dead cows in location 16.

Remember that Raven asked the party to re-capture the specimens and that
if the party kills any specimens they will forfeit the magic items as
reward (but will still receive gold). The party should be able to
capture the Owlbear using non-lethal damage in a similar way to
capturing the Mouther earlier in the adventure. If the Owlbear is killed
but the Hydra is captured then Raven can be persuaded to still provide
the magic items with a DC15 Persuasion check.

Most of the handlers that would normally be here, monitoring the
specimens, were all killed at location 3.

If the shields have been re-initialised at Shield Control (location 9)
then pressing each button activates / deactivates one shield as
described under the heading How the Shields Work on page 20. Remember
the top button controls the blue shield that is furthest away – in this
case between the 40’ wide enclosure entrance and the corridor.

##  16. Larder

This room is full of dead cows, although the feedstock and water tank
along one wall indicate that they would normally be alive. It looks like
they were ripped apart by the Owlbear. The cows are behind a chest high
gate that is not locked.

The characters may decide to lure the Hydra by showing it a dead cow
which they could drag to an enclosure via area 15.

**Game Master Tip:** If you have more than one gaming session available
then you may choose to increase the duration and difficulty of this
adventure by returning one or more of the dead specimens to life. Refer
to Appendix D on page 34 for suggestions.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Main NPCs" tags="index @main-npcs" position="352,603" size="100,100">

## Wizard Aldritch

![medium](./images/aldritch.jpg)

Personality

Aldritch’s passion is to cross breed monsters that he captures and

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="The Zoo" tags="" position="938,514" size="100,100">## The Zoo

From the large main yard (with the single storey wooden building where
the party met Raven) there is a trail to the northwest which leads to
the Zoo. The trail is regularly patrolled by two **Guards**.

The Zoo only contains common beasts (panthers, boars, badgers, owls,
etc). In addition to animal enclosures the zoo compound includes;
Raven’s house, a barracks that houses 20 **Guards** (6 of which are in
attendance during the day as the others patrol the grounds), various
sheds and store rooms.

There is nothing of interest to the adventurers in the Zoo. It is a
private display for the lords and ladies of Hilt Island and is not open
to the common people. If the party insists on exploring it, make it
clear there is nothing of interest. If necessary guards or Raven can
guide them back to the Research Centre.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Holding Room" tags="" position="791,94" size="100,100">
# Holding Room

**Time Elapsed:-** In testing it took the party about 1 hour to reach
this point. This should be considered a guide only. Your party will take
as long as it takes them to get to this point. However, these timing
guidelines are provided for your reference in case you have limited time
for your game. If that is the case you may wish to limit the time the
party spends on tasks you do not consider core to this adventure.

From the main yard the Research Centre is accessed via a large 15’
square door built into the side of a hill to the east. There is a single
**Guard** on duty.

Raven holds her palm to a 6” square silver entry plate which is set into
the wall next to the door. There is a hum and the door magically slides
sideways into the hill. Beyond the door is a warehouse which contains a
number of large empty cages on the north wall as well as feedstock in
sacks and crates along the south wall. Straight ahead on the east wall
is another 15’ square door with a square silver entry plate next to it.

The ceiling has magical lighting panels which Raven explains are
throughout the centre for the convenience of the staff.

Raven tells the party to deposit the Mouther in one of the empty cages.
She then gives it a quick examination and checks its vital signs.
Satisfied that it will regain consciousness in due course she locks it
in the cage and invites the party to sit with her at a wooden table on
the south wall.

Raven looks each party member in the eye. Satisfied with what she sees,
Raven reveals the difficult task ahead:

-   A number of the research specimens are powerful monsters and so are
    confined in their enclosures by magical shields.

-   Some monsters are so large that they barely fit through the 15’
    square doors throughout the centre.

-   A violent lightning storm occurred about a month ago and the
    research centre was hit by lightning multiple times. This caused the
    magical shields restraining the creatures to fail.

-   The research centre was overrun with specimens trying to get out.

-   Wizard Aldritch is away and Raven has to deal with the
    crisis herself. She is looking for a group of adventurers to help
    her solve the problem.

-   She doesn’t want the specimens killed, just put back in their cages.
    This is very important to her.

-   Her Father has an amulet that will re-initiate the shields but it’s
    in his Inner Sanctum (location 8 below) which Raven is magically
    barred from entering.

-   If asked Raven can explain how the shields work (refer to page 20).

-   Raven is prepared to offer the choice of either 1,000gp or a magic
    item for each party member which they may choose from a range of
    items available. With good negotiation the party may be able to
    convince Raven to provide both the items and some of the money
    (DC15 persuasion).

-   If Raven notices a PC with a particular affinity towards her
    animals, or if a party member asks, then she might gift them an
    animal companion as a reward at the end of the adventure. The
    creature should have less than 5HP. Good options include an: Owl,
    Eagle, Frog, Badger, Mastiff, etc.

-   Raven makes it clear that if the party kills specimens they will not
    receive any magic items.

-   If the party asks then Raven will show them the items and money in
    The Safe (location 1a).

-   Raven does not have any information on the current specimens.
    Specimens come and go and she leaves their day to day care
    to others.

-   Raven will describe the basic layout once the party exits the
    quarantine room: “A large 15&#39; wide corridor heads east. Straight
    ahead (east) leads to the Inner Sanctum and to the right (south) are
    the Specimen Enclosures.”

-   She has never been in locations 5-9 (Daddy likes his privacy).


## The Safe

At the west end of the southern wall of the Holding Room (location 1) is
a heavy iron door. Raven has the key. After opening the safe door a
green magical shield prevents entry to the room beyond although the
party can see through the shield.

The shield can only be lowered with the Shield Amulet from the Inner
Sanctum (location 8). To the left of the door is a round pedestal. Place
the amulet in the hexagonal slot in the top of the pedestal and turn
ninety degrees anti-clockwise (de-activating shields is always
anti-clockwise). The shield will disappear.

A Detect Magic spell will detect the abjuration magic of the shield and
can faintly detect through the shield that a number of the items in the
safe are magical but the shield prevents more detailed information.
There is also 3,000gp worth of coins in various denominations stacked on
shelves.

The safe contains the following magic items:

-   Circlet of Blasting (Bracelet)

-   Cloak of Protection (Cloak)

-   Dust of Disappearance (Pouch)

-   Eyes of Minute Seeing (Crystal Lenses)

-   Gloves of Missile Snaring (Gloves)

-   Headband of Wisdom (Headband)

-   Javelin of Lightning (Javelin)

The party members may each select one magic item once they are
successful.

A DC8 Insight check on Raven will show that she is telling the truth
about the reward and that she will provide it once the party is
successful.

# Quarantine Room

When the party are ready to proceed, Raven places her palm on the silver
entry plate to the right of the door to location 2 and it magically
slides to one side. Whenever a door has a silver entry plate then any
character may open or close the door by placing their palm on the plate.
She accompanies the party into the room.

This room quarantines the Holding Room from the rest of the research
centre.

It is normally a blank room but because of the crisis the magical wards
put in place by the Wizard Aldritch have activated and this room now
quarantines the facility, preventing the creatures from leaving and
making entry a risky process.

From the entry door there is a 10’ gap and then a shimmering transparent
curtain of air with a faint green tinge. The magical green shield has
large magical writing on it: “Research Centre Under Quarantine – Do Not
Enter”.

Beyond the curtain is what looks like a giant chess board with each
square 5’ on a side. At the other end of the board is a second green
shield, then a 10’ gap to the closed 15’ wide exit door. The exit door
has a square silver plate on the wall next to it which you assume may
open the door.

&gt; Stepping through the curtain gives a tingling sensation of magic. The
&gt; first character to step through the curtain and place both feet on a
&gt; square triggers a magical hologram of Wizard Aldritch who says:
&gt;
&gt; “Aaaah, not one to heed warnings aye? Well I see you’ve selected a
&gt; knight, bishop, rook, king or queen, depending on which square
&gt; they stepped onto.”
&gt;
&gt; The corresponding piece knight, bishop, etc appears directly
&gt; opposite the character. Roll initiative.
&gt;
&gt; If you don’t have access to a chess set then make pieces by writing
&gt; the name of the piece on a 1” square of paper or card.
&gt;
&gt; The hologram then disappears. Although if you wish you may make the
&gt; hologram remain in place and have it taunt the party during the game
&gt; saying things like: “Foolish move” or “Are you trying to get yourself
&gt; killed? Mmmmm?” NB: this is a semi-interactive recording and not
&gt; Wizard Aldritch live.


**Example of How this Room Works**

Say there are 4 party members;

-   Conrad the Cleric

-   Ferd the Fighter

-   Marvin the Mage

-   Deg the Druid

Say Conrad steps through the green magical curtain onto the second
square from the left which would normally be occupied by a Knight in a
game of chess. A Knight appears opposite Conrad as shown below (squares
are 5’):

**Chess Pieces / Moves Explanation**

If you haven’t played chess before here’s a brief explanation of how the
pieces move:

**R = Rook (Castle)** – The rook moves in a straight line either
horizontally or vertically through any number of unoccupied squares,
until it reaches the end of the board or it is blocked by another piece.

**K = Knight (Horse)** — The knight is the only piece on the board that
may jump over other pieces. The knight moves two squares horizontally or
vertically and then one more square at a right-angle. The knight’s move
is always shaped as an “L”.

**B = Bishop** — The bishop moves in a straight line diagonally on the
board. It can move as many squares as wanted, until it meets the end of
the board or another piece.

**Q = Queen** — It can move any number of squares in a straight line —
either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

**Kg = King** — The king can move to any adjacent square. That is, it
can move one square in any direction: horizontally, vertically or
diagonally.

Back to our example: both Conrad and the Knight may only move like a
Knight in a chess game. The Knight will have the stats, abilities,
spells and spell slots of Conrad and his face can be seen dimly on the
stone chess piece.

Record which player spawned which enemy chess piece when they step
through the magical curtain and any key stats you may wish to remember.
You don’t need to write down everything and can ask the players for
their character sheets whenever you wish:

| **Player Name Entered Board** | **Chess Piece They Spawned** | **Chess Piece’s Key Stats ** |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Eg: Conrad the Cleric         | Eg: Knight                   | Eg: HP23 AC16                |
|                               |                              |                              |
|                               |                              |                              |
|                               |                              |                              |
|                               |                              |                              |
|                               |                              |                              |
|                               |                              |                              |

This example is for the Game Master only. The players will have to
figure out the rules of the room for themselves.

**Combat on the Chess Board**

-   Roll Initiative for all players as soon as the first player enters
    the chess board.

-   Each chess piece has the same initiative roll as the player that
    spawned it and will always take their turn after that player. Eg:
    Conrad continues his turn after entering the board and then it’s the
    Knights turn.

-   The player inherits the movement characteristics of the chess piece
    they spawned. Eg: Conrad must move like a Knight does in chess. A
    player may make a move on the chess board after they step through
    the curtain.

-   Players normal movement distance is not used when on the
    chess board. They have the movement of the chess piece they spawned.
    Players may Dash in order to move again in their turn.

-   Players and chess pieces may use missile attacks and spells (if they
    have them) as normal in their turn but missiles and spells cannot
    pass through the green magical curtains in either direction.

-   Players and chess pieces on adjacent squares may make melee attacks
    as normal and normal combat rules apply.

-   An exception to normal combat is that characters and chess pieces
    may not move through squares occupied by other characters or chess
    pieces except for the Knight which jumps over
    intervening players/pieces.

-   No square may have more than one player or piece occupying it
    at once. Ie; characters and pieces may not share a square. Not even
    a Knight may move to an occupied square.

-   If a character falls unconscious on the chess board and all of their
    party members are either unconscious on the chess board, or have
    exited the chess board, then the unconscious player(s) will be
    teleported off the chess board and will appear where they started,
    between the magical green curtain and the door to the Holding Room
    (location 1). Raven Aldritch is waiting there and will use her
    veterinary skills to bring the character back to consciousness
    with 1HP. If this occurs the corresponding chess piece will be
    removed when the character is teleported. If they re-enter the chess
    board then a new piece will spawn depending on the square they enter
    the chess board on.

**Exiting the Chess Board**

When a character exits the chess board by moving through the magical
green curtain towards the Preparation Room (Location 4), the chess piece
they spawned is removed. Eg: when Conrad exits the chess board the
Knight he spawned will disappear. The characters movement immediately
returns to normal.

Once all party members have exited the chess board the exit door unlocks
and the door may then be opened by touching the silver plate on the wall
next to the door. If no party members exit and all fall unconscious on
the chess board then they are all teleported (see Combat on the Chess
Board above).

**The Magical Green Curtains**

Raven Aldritch cannot pass through the magical green curtains. Her
father does not want her in the facility because of the quarantine. She
will remain behind once the party exits this room.

The magical green curtains only allow creatures and objects to move in
one direction ie; they allow creatures to enter the facility but not to
leave.

So once a character has moved through the first green curtain onto the
chess board they cannot go back (unless they fall unconscious and the
chess board teleports them – see above).

Missile weapons and magic cannot pass through the green curtains.

Green curtains cannot be dispelled.

**Representing the Board**

You can draw the room or you can use a chess board.

**Moving to the next location**

Once the door unlocks (see Exiting the Chess Board above) the characters
may open the door and move into the corridor beyond.

**Difficulty:-** This encounter is self-balancing for any sized party.

**Experience**

Every character that makes it across the chess board earns 300XP
regardless of whether they fought the chess pieces or not. Killing the
chess pieces provides no additional experience.

# Talking Door

The Door to the Cupboards of Doom room (location 7) is a magical talking
door.

The corridor is blocked by a stone door with a carved stone face and the
word “Spawn” (in Common) chiselled into its forehead.

“Hello there,” says the door in a friendly tone of voice.

The door is very friendly and while it would be happy to answer
questions it honestly doesn’t know anything. The doors face can be quite
animated.

The door doesn’t know how to open itself as it has the attention span of
a goldfish and doesn’t remember the last time it was opened. However, if
the door can be made to say the word “Spawn” out loud then the door
opens. When it opens, the door is very surprised and isn’t sure what’s
happening (it doesn’t remember having opened before and the motion is
quite disconcerting for it).

One of the party will probably eventually ask the door why it has a word
on its forehead. The door is unaware of this fact. If they tell the door
it has the word “Spawn” on its forehead, you may like to have the door
repeat what the character said eg: “Really? I have the word Spawn
written on my forehead?” and because the door said “Spawn” out loud the
door will open.

The door has a very faint line around it which is the gap to the
surrounding wall. It has no handle or visible hinges. Brute strength can
be used but the door has 100 HP and is immune to slashing and piercing
damage from non-magical weapons.

As background: When the Wizard Aldritch wishes the door to open he
speaks the password “Doth Kalidus” and the door opens and the
protections in the Cupboards of Doom room are disabled. Of course the
party has no way of knowing this.

Raven has never been past this door as the door has been instructed to
ignore her and anything she may say. Her Father does not want her to
enter. This is simply background as Raven is still in the Quarantine
Room.

**Experience**

If the door is opened or bypassed without smashing it down then each
party member gains 150 XP. If they smash it they receive no experience
as they haven’t learned anything!

# Cupboards of Doom

**Time Elapsed:-** In testing it took the party about 2 hours and 35
minutes to reach this point.

This long room is separated into two halves by a large crevasse (about
13’ wide). There are two doors on this side of the crevasse (one on each
side wall). There are also two doors on the other side of the crevasse
(one on each side wall). There is a door in the centre of the opposite
wall. All doors are 5’ wide and wooden.

The crevasse is 60’ deep and any character falling into it will take 6d6
falling damage.

The 4 doors with 5’ square cupboards behind them are where the undead
spawn. Doors open into the room and automatically close after an undead
creature exits the cupboard.

Once the room is described and the party has a plan to get across the
crevasse, but before they try it, a magical hologram of the Wizard
Aldritch appears in the air over the crevasse and says:

“I’ve been notified that you are trying to gain access to my inner
sanctum. Either you’ll die trying, which I guess is bad for you, or I’ll
be forced to return and deal with you which you’ll find to be infinitely
worse. You have 6 seconds to leave!”

-   Roll for initiative immediately.

-   If the party doesn’t leave in the first round of combat then at the
    beginning of the second round of combat the 4 doors open and undead
    come out.

Each turn of combat a random undead creature comes out of each of the
four doors. Roll 1d6 on the following table four times (roll them all at
once and allocate the undead to the cupboards as you see fit):

1-3 **Skeleton **

4-5 **Zombie**

6 **Ghoul** \*

\* Maximum of one Ghoul arrives per turn. If you roll more than one
Ghoul then replace with a Zombie.

**Difficulty:-** The above assumes a party of 4 player characters. If
the party has 3 characters only roll for 3 of the doors rather than 4.
If the party has 5 or 6 characters then ignore the one Ghoul maximum per
turn.

Ghouls and Zombies will tend to spawn on the side of the crevasse
closest to the Talking Door and will try to enter melee combat with the
party.

Skeletons have bows and short swords so have no preference of spawning
location.

If a zombie or ghoul comes out on the side of the crevasse closest to
the Inner Sanctum, and no characters are on the same side of the
crevasse, then they might attack each other or try to jump the crevasse
to get at the party (50/50 random chance). Zombies and Ghouls have only
just enough strength to try a running jump to get over the crevasse and
so will land right on the edge and will need to make a DC12 Dexterity
Saving Throw to not fall backwards into the crevasse. Zombies will
rarely make it due to their awful dexterity and this can provide some
opportunities for amusing descriptions of undead acrobatics!

This is a battle of attrition. There is an unending supply of undead and
unless the adventurers block the cupboard doors, or jam them shut to
prevent them opening, or cross the crevasse and exit the opposite door,
then they are probably going to be in deep trouble!

Cupboard doors:

-   Are wooden and open into the room so they can be jammed closed with
    a piton, dagger or similar, wedged under the door.

-   It is difficult for the undead trapped in a cupboard with a jammed
    door to break out, due to the confined space, and they will need to
    pass a DC18 strength check to do so.

-   If the party destroy or remove the doors this does not stop new
    undead from spawning.

-   If a character enters a cupboard and an undead spawns next to them
    the undead will try to grapple the character in their turn.

**Jumping**

Characters that wish to jump the crevasse must have Strength of 13 or
better and must move at least 10’ in a straight line before the jump. If
the character has Strength of exactly 13, have them make an Athletics or
Acrobatics check (their choice) on a DC 12. If they fail they fall into
the crevasse and take 6d6 falling damage. Characters with 14 or higher
strength clear the crevasse sufficiently to not require the check.

Pitons can be hammered between the stone floor tiles to anchor a rope.

As background, if the correct password (Doth Kalidus) is spoken to the
Talking Door then the undead are suspended and a magical bridge over the
chasm appears. Of course this won’t happen because the party won’t know
the password. Therefore the room’s defences will be fully active to
protect Wizard Aldritch’s Inner Sanctum regardless of how the party went
through or bypassed the Talking Door.

If the party is having difficulties remind them that they can always
retreat, regroup and try again. If all of the party exit the room
through the Talking Door and close it behind them (by telling the door
to say “spawn” out loud) then the undead will not follow them and will
simply disappear. The room will be reset ready for when the party
return, so if they are being overwhelmed this is a good option.

Undead will not leave this room voluntarily. If they are forced to leave
the room (for example, if a Cleric uses Channel Divinity: Turn Undead)
then they will turn to dust as soon as they leave the room.

**Exit**

The wooden door to the Inner Sanctum is not locked. Once the entire
party exits the room (either into the Inner Sanctum or back through the
Talking Door) the undead will disappear and the room will reset.

**Experience**

In addition to any experience earned for killing undead, characters also
gain 150XP each for gaining access to the Inner Sanctum.

For ease of reference during what is almost certain to become a large
combat, the Ghoul, Skeleton and Zombie stats are repeated together on
this page.

# Inner Sanctum

The wooden door to this room is not locked. When the party enters this
room and closes the door the Cupboards of Doom room resets and all
undead disappear.

This large room is the study of the powerful Wizard Aldritch.

This large room is two stories tall with an arched ceiling. The right
half of this room contains floor to ceiling bookshelves with thousands
of books (reached by ladders).

These books cover all manner of topics: history, medicine, religion,
sociology and psychology. These are non-magical texts.

On the left side of the room there is a large desk with three books open
to pictures of three different large monstrous creatures. There is
parchment, a quill and various coloured inks. A half-finished drawing of
a creature is in the centre of the desk. It appears to be a combination
of the three pictures in the three books.

Four large glass cabinets contain all manner of items. They have many
shelves and drawers.

The three books on the desk show pictures of creatures not of this plane
of existence and so the party do not recognise them. Wizard Aldritch is
looking at innovative ways to combine these creatures into a single very
powerful monster.

In the desk drawers are various papers and letters. A DC15 Investigation
check identifies one surprising letter dated several months ago from the
clerk of the Edrassan King Torrent. The letter confirms a meeting in the
Edrassan capital, Astridon. This is a clue that Wizard Aldritch may not
be a loyal Templite.

The glass cabinets contain any spell component a Wizard might require
for all spells of Level 1-9 (including all of those with gold piece
values). Characters can take these and use them during the adventure but
Wizard Aldritch will take them back at the end (see Adventure Conclusion
on page 24).

Along the wall behind the desk there are three items (from left to
right): a pedestal on which sits a heavy leather bound book, a pedestal
on which sits an amulet with a large blue hexagonal gem, and a wooden
rack for holding a large staff (the rack is currently empty).

**Heavy Leather Bound Book**

This book includes fine metal scroll work on the cover. It is a backup
copy of Aldritch’s spell book. He has spent more than one lifetime
collecting spells and studying magic. The book includes all Wizard
spells of Level 1 to 9.

If the book is opened a magical mouth appears above and behind the book
and says in an English accent:

-   “Oi! Now see here. Who the blazes are you?”

-   The book likes to talk and will do so constantly when the book
    is open. It will ask questions such as:

    -   “Who are you then?” and

    -   “What are you doin’ in my guvna’s study?” and

    -   will tell the party they shouldn’t be here.

-   It will not provide any information to the party unless they
    threaten to destroy the book.

-   Closing the book will stop it speaking.

A wizard may copy spells from the book using the normal rules. There are
enough magical inks on the desk to copy 3 spells. Characters can take
the book but Wizard Aldritch will take it back at the end (see Adventure
Conclusion on page 24).

**Blue Shield Amulet**

The blue Shield Amulet is what the party has come to find. It is magical
and controls the shield spells. It is hexagonal in shape and fits:

-   the pedestal outside the Quarantine Room (to remove the quarantine)
    at location 3;

-   the pedestal outside the Safe (location 1a); and

-   the pedestal in the Shield Control Room (location 9) to
    re-initialise the shields in the Specimen Enclosures.

This room is a safe location to take a rest should the party wish to do
so.

**Exit**

The only way out of the Inner Sanctum is back through the Cupboards of
Doom which has been reset and there are no longer any undead in the
room. Have the party roll initiative before they enter the Cupboards of
Doom room from the Inner Sanctum.

At the end of the first round:

The magical hologram of the Wizard Aldritch re-appears in the air over
the crevasse and he says “I see you made it into my private chambers.
Well now you have to get out again. Of course if you succeed then I’ll
have to deal with you myself!”

Undead appear at the beginning of the second round of combat following
the rules specified for location 7.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Notas" tags="lugares @notas" position="592,347" size="100,100">
# How the Shields Work

Each enclosure has a shield control pedestal at each entrance to the
enclosure. The entrance from the main corridor is 40’ wide while the
entrance from location 15 is 5’ wide.

If the shields have been re-initialised at Shield Control (location 9)
then pressing each button activates / deactivates one shield as follows:

-   The top button controls the blue shield that is furthest away from
    the pedestal ie: if you are using the pedestal at the 40’ wide
    entrance then the shield furthest from you is across the 5’ opening
    at the rear of the enclosure. But if you are at location 15 then the
    shield furthest from you is the 40’ wide shield separating the
    enclosure from the main corridor.

-   The middle button controls the blue shield that bisects the
    enclosure (refer to the map). This is used for containing specimens
    in half the enclosure for cleaning, feeding and
    maintenance purposes.

-   The bottom button controls the blue shield closest to the pedestal.

No creature can pass through a blue shield once activated and shields
completely fill the opening they are designed to block. Ie; you can’t go
over, under or around them. Trying to excavate rock or dig underneath
the shield will not work as the shield will expand to fill the space
created. Shields cannot be dispelled.

Shields will not activate if a specimen is in the way. We can’t have the
specimens cut in half by mistake now can we! The players will need to
figure out why the shield failed to activate.

When shields activate or deactivate, an electric buzzing fills the air
and everyone’s hair stands on end. There is a loud pop and a blue
magical shield appears / disappears.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Gorgon Enclosure" tags="encounter" position="905,234" size="100,100">
# Gorgon Enclosure

This description assumes the party are standing in the 15’ wide circular
corridor:

Squatting next to a waist high pedestal is a man dressed in the ragged
remains of a handler’s khaki uniform. About 30’ beyond him is a dead
creature – the top half is a large humanoid (the size of an ogre) and
the lower half is a large serpent. The creature has been half devoured
and in fact there is currently a massive monster chomping on one of its
arms. This massive creature has 3 heads, although it looks like at one
point it had 5. The two necks that used to have heads have been
cauterised. Both the dead creature and the live one are in the corridor.

One head is chewing on the dead creature while the other two heads
appear to be asleep.

The handler sees you enter the corridor and his eyes go wide with the
hope of rescue. He stands up and runs toward you shouting, “Help me,
please help me!” The monstrous creature’s heads whip around and it
charges towards the man who is running towards the party. Roll for
initiative.

The handler is a human **Commoner** and he is 25’ away. In his weakened
state he can dash 20’ per turn. His name is Lash and he has been living
off scraps and water in the enclosures for the past month. He has been
driven crazy by constant fear and won’t necessarily behave rationally.
His only motivation is to escape.

The dead creature was a Gorgon. The living creature chomping on it is a
**Hydra** which is 30’ from Lash and 55’ from the party.

The **Hydra** has taken damage from the other creatures it fought when
the shields failed and the flame damage it has received could not be
healed. The party may decide to try and lure it into an enclosure and
seal it in, fight it or run away. The entrances to location 15 are only
5’ wide and the Hydra is too large to follow, although its heads can
attack into the first 10’ of the corridor / area.

The Hydra is looking for fresh food and although it was Lash’s shout and
movement that attracted its attention, it will attack the party as soon
as Lash is dead or if the party attack.

Remember that Raven asked the party to re-capture the specimens and that
if the party kills any specimens they will forfeit the magic items as
reward (but will still receive gold). The Hydra, along with the Owlbear
in location 15, are the only specimens left alive and capturing them
will provide the magic items reward from Raven. When the shields failed
the specimens fought and killed each other which is not the parties
fault and Raven will understand.

**Example of trapping the Hydra:**

If the party can lure the Hydra into an enclosure then they can trap it
using the shields, either from the corridor control pedestal or from the
handler’s room control pedestal, for that enclosure.

The Hydra will charge after any people or food it sees.

For example, if the party is at location 15 and the Hydra is at location
12 they could taunt the Hydra through the 5’ opening to the enclosure
from the Handler’s Room. The Hydra would charge towards them and would
then be in the enclosure itself (draw a line between location 12 and
location 15 to see the path the Hydra may take). The Hydra is too big to
fit through the 5’ opening, although its heads could attack through it
to a distance of 10’. However, once the Hydra is in the enclosure it
should be a simple task for the party to use the adjacent shield control
pedestal to raise the shields, trapping the Hydra (refer to the heading
‘How the Shields Work’ page 20).

Alternatively they could do something clever with the cows in the Larder
(location 16) to tempt the **Hydra**.

**Difficulty:-** The above assumes a party of 4 player characters (level
3). If the party has 3 reduce the **Hydra** to 85 HP. If the party has 5
characters increase to 125 HP. For 6 characters give it 140 HP and 4
heads.

**Tension &amp; Excitement:-** it is important that the party doesn’t trap
the **Hydra** too easily. It should be a tense situation where the
perceived consequences of failure should be dire!

Once the party has contained the **Hydra** behind a shield, or killed
it, (and assuming they’ve dealt with the Owlbear at location 15 already)
then they have achieved the objective set by Raven Aldritch and may
return to location 2 to claim their reward (see Adventure Conclusion on
page 24).
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Index" tags="index welcome" position="307,458.5" size="100,100"># Welcome, Adventurer,
You have in your hands a **Tabletop RPG** adventure designed to be mastered from a tablet.
This is a medieval-fantasy adventure that uses *SRD5 System* and can be adapted to any game world.

## What is a roleplaying game?
Roleplaying games consist of taking on roles, usually in fantasy worlds. You have to imagine how your adventurer would face the challenges presented by the game’s director. You play sitting around a table with your friends, with a few dice and ready to have a good time.

## What do I need to play?
To play this adventure, you need to be familiarized with the *SRD5 System* and have dice and a pencil and paper. **The adventure itself gives you the necessary rules to resolve each encounter**. You will also need character sheets.

You can read a [synopsis of the adventure](./index.html?param=@resumen) or go directly to [[Starting the Adventure]] .

## How does GameThrough work?
*GameThrough* divides the adventure’s content into encounters and scenes. The difference between encounters and scenes is only from the point of view of the story. In the encounters, a concrete situation is resolved - for example, a battle or an investigation - while the scenes describe more open-ended situations, such as exploring a city. Encounters and scenes are linked depending on players’ decisions. In the bottom left you will always find the *GameThrough* menu.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/summary/gamethrough.jpg&quot; class=&quot;icons-center&quot;&gt;

### Encounters and Scenes
On the left, you will have three tabs (At a glance, Body, Conclusion) and the icons with illustrations, maps, enemies and music.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/summary/gamethrough-2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;icons-center&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* **At a  glance**, describes what the characters can see in the encounter, using their skills.

* **Body**, is the default tab with links to illustrations, enemies, maps and music.

* **Conclusion**, describes the consequences of the characters’ actions. 

* On the right, you will find the text for the encounter or scene. 

### GameThrough Bar
The *GameThrough* bar offers four indexes so you can move around in the adventure. Each index corresponds to one of the following icons:
&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-1.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to the adventure’s classic index.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-2.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to a map with all the adventure’s locations &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-3.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to a list of all the non-player characters relevant to the adventure. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-4.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to a time diagram of the adventure. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-izquierda.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-derecha.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; With these icons, you will be able to navigate around the encounters you have already visited. &lt;/div&gt;

### Indexed rules
All the rules you need to resolve the adventure’s situations will appear on the left-hand side of the screen when you click on one of the [red links](#) or on *italics*.

DigitalD20 is an App that is the brainchild of a group of roleplayers. While we were using tablets during games, we began to wonder if we could harness books in digital form. It has taken us years, but this is the final result.

## The Adventure Begins

Sections of text with Grey background should be read to the players:

&gt; You are on the large island of Hilt which is part of the Temple Empire.
&gt; The island is currently a battleground after being invaded by the
&gt; Edrassan Kingdom. The party was in Carlin Town which is in the southeast of the island and occupied by the Edrassans.

Looking for adventure that doesn’t involve taking sides in the conflict,
you are responding to an advert you saw at the local tavern. You are
currently walking west along the road from Carlin town towards the
Aldritch Research Centre and Zoo. There is some sort of unspecified
trouble there and rich rewards to be had (according to the advert).

You camped overnight and then continued walking west along the road.
There is a forest to the north and a swamp called The Fen to the south.
About mid-morning you see your destination ahead.

A large sign straddles the road: “The Aldritch Research Centre and Zoo”.
Beyond the sign is a large yard with a single storey wooden building.
Under the sign is a guard hut and two guards step out into the road and
motion you to stop. They are wearing khaki uniforms with the coat of
arms for the research centre on the tunic. The closest guard says, “This
centre is not open to the common folk.”

If the party explains they are responding to the advert then one
**Guard** escorts them to the wooden building in the middle of the large
yard and tell them to wait outside while he knocks and enters. After a
minute or so he re-appears and beckons the party to enter. He leads them
to a room where **Raven Aldritch** is tending to a sick white tiger cub
on an examination table. She hands the cub over to an assistant (human
**Commoner** female).

**Game Master Tip:** names in **bold** have stats and descriptions in
Appendix A or B depending on whether they are Monsters or Non-Player
Characters.

Raven is a pretty woman in her mid-twenties. She is dressed in khaki
trousers and a smock with multiple pockets.

What Raven is willing to communicate to the party:

-   She placed the advert in Carlin Town which the party is
    responding to.

-   She runs the Zoo and keeps an eye on the Research Centre when her
    father, The **Wizard Aldritch**, is away.

-   Raven does not know where **Wizard Aldritch** is at the moment but
    it is not unusual for him to be gone for long periods of time
    without contact.

-   She has an important and lucrative task for the party to complete
    but first she must be sure that they can look after themselves and
    so she has something of a test task for them. It is still important
    and carries a reward. She won’t give them the main task first as it
    is too important to entrust to just anyone.

## The First Task

-   A Mouther has been reported in the swamp close by (it is a
    **Gibbering Mouther** but Raven is not aware of this fact).

-   It will make a good research subject and she would like the party to
    capture it.

-   The **Wizard Aldritch** conducts research on various beasts,
    aberrations and monstrosities in order to improve their strengths or
    minimise their weaknesses. It is something of a hobby for him.

-   Historically the research centre has permanent staff to capture test
    subjects but these wranglers got caught up in the war. One went to
    fight for the Templites and the other was hanged when he tried to
    passively resist the occupying Edrassan army (he staged a sit in
    demanding that the Edrassan’s withdraw from the island. The sit in
    was violently broken up and several people were hanged as an example
    to others).

-   Capturing the Mouther alive earns a 100gp reward (or if the party
    negotiate well Raven could be convinced to go up to 150gp with a
    DC15 Persuasion check). Once completed Raven will then reveal the
    main task and reward.

This is a test to see if the party has the skills needed to assist with
the main problem and whether they can be trusted.
