<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="phantom-steed">Phantom Steed</h1>
<p><em>3rd-level illusion (ritual)</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour </p>
<p>A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.  <br/>
For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/riding_horse/index.html">Riding Horse</a>, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.</p></div>
