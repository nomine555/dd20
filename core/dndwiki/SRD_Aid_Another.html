<p>In melee combat, you can help a friend attack or defend by distracting or interfering with an opponent. If you’re in position to make a <a href="SRD_Melee_Attack.html" title="SRD:Melee Attack" class="mw-redirect">melee attack</a> on an opponent that is engaging a friend in melee combat, you can attempt to aid your friend as a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>. You make an <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack roll</a> against <a href="SRD_AC.html" title="SRD:AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a> 10. If you succeed, your friend gains either a +2 bonus on his next <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack roll</a> against that opponent or a +2 bonus to <a href="SRD_AC.html" title="SRD:AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a> against that opponent’s next attack (your choice), as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next turn. Multiple characters can aid the same friend, and similar bonuses stack.
</p><p>You can also use this <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> to help a friend in other ways, such as when he is affected by a <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Spell" title="SRD:Spell" class="mw-redirect">spell</a>, or to assist another character’s <a href="SRD_Skills.html" title="SRD:Skills">skill check</a>.
