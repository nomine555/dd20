<p><b>Alignment:</b> Any nonlawful.
</p><p><b><a href="SRD_Race_Descriptions.html#Starting_Age" title="SRD:Race Descriptions">Starting Age</a>:</b> Moderate.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Class_Features">Class Features</span></h4>
<p>All of the following are <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> features of the bard.
</p><p><b><span id="Weapon_and_Armor_Proficiency">Weapon and Armor Proficiency</span>:</b> A bard is proficient with all <a href="SRD_Simple_Weapon_Proficiency.html" title="SRD:Simple Weapon Proficiency">simple weapons</a>, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Bards are proficient with <a href="SRD_Armor_Proficiency_(Light).html" title="SRD:Armor Proficiency (Light)">light armor</a> and <a href="SRD_Shield_Proficiency.html" title="SRD:Shield Proficiency">shields</a> (except <a href="SRD_Tower_Shield_Proficiency.html" title="SRD:Tower Shield Proficiency">tower shields</a>). A bard can cast bard spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Arcane_Spell_Failure_Chance" title="SRD:Arcane Spell Failure Chance" class="mw-redirect">arcane spell failure chance</a>. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do). A <a href="SRD_Multiclass_Characters.html" title="SRD:Multiclass Characters">multiclass</a> bard still incurs the normal <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Arcane_Spell_Failure_Chance" title="SRD:Arcane Spell Failure Chance" class="mw-redirect">arcane spell failure chance</a> for arcane spells received from other <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">classes</a>.
</p><p><b><span id="Spells">Spells</span>:</b> A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the <a href="SRD_Bard_Spell_List.html" title="SRD:Bard Spell List">bard spell list</a>. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing, reciting, or music). To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a> score equal to at least 10 + the spell. The <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">Difficulty Class</a> for a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> against a bard’s spell is 10 + the <a href="SRD_Spell_Level.html" title="SRD:Spell Level" class="mw-redirect">spell level</a> + the bard’s <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a> modifier.
</p><p>Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each <a href="SRD_Spell_Level.html" title="SRD:Spell Level" class="mw-redirect">spell level</a> per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on <a href="#Table:_The_Bard">Table: The Bard</a>. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a> score. When <a href="#Table:_Bard_Spells_Known">Table: Bard Spells Known</a> indicates that the bard gets 0 spells per day of a given <a href="SRD_Spell_Level.html" title="SRD:Spell Level" class="mw-redirect">spell level</a>, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a> score for that <a href="SRD_Spell_Level.html" title="SRD:Spell Level" class="mw-redirect">spell level</a>.
</p><p>The bard’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells of your choice. At most new bard levels, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on <a href="#Table:_Bard_Spells_Known">Table: Bard Spells Known</a>. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a> score; the numbers on <a href="#Table:_Bard_Spells_Known">Table: Bard Spells Known</a> are fixed.)
</p><p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard can cast. A bard may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.
</p><p>As noted above, a bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.

<p><b><span id="Bardic_Music">Bardic Music</span>:</b> Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if desired). While these abilities fall under the category of bardic music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrical songs, singing melodies, whistling, playing an instrument, or playing an instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> skill to qualify; if a bard does not have the required number of ranks in at least one <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> skill, he does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the needed ranks.
</p><p>Starting a bardic music effect is a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a>. Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> to maintain the ability. Even while using bardic music that doesn’t require concentration, a bard cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as <a href="SRD_Scrolls.html" title="SRD:Scrolls">scrolls</a>), or activate magic items by magic word (such as <a href="SRD_Wands.html" title="SRD:Wands">wands</a>). Just as for casting a spell with a verbal component, a deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the attempt still counts against his daily limit.
</p><p><i><span id="Countersong">Countersong</span> (<a href="SRD_Special_Abilities_Overview.html#Supernatural" title="SRD:Special Abilities Overview">Su</a>):</i> A bard with 3 or more ranks in a <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> skill can use his music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components). Each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> of the countersong, he makes a <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a sonic or <a href="SRD_Language-Dependent_Effect.html" title="SRD:Language-Dependent Effect">language-dependent</a> magical attack may use the bard’s <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> check result in place of its <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> if, after the <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> is rolled, the <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> against the effect each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard’s <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> check result for the save. Countersong has no effect against effects that don’t allow saves. The bard may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds.
</p><p><i><span id="Fascinate">Fascinate</span> (<a href="SRD_Special_Abilities_Overview.html#Spell-Like" title="SRD:Special Abilities Overview">Sp</a>):</i> A bard with 3 or more ranks in a <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> skill can use his music or poetics to cause one or more creatures to become <a href="SRD_Fascinated.html" title="SRD:Fascinated">fascinated</a> with him. Each creature to be <a href="SRD_Fascinated.html" title="SRD:Fascinated">fascinated</a> must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability.
</p><p>To use the ability, a bard makes a <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> check. His check result is the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> for each affected creature’s <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Will</a> save against the effect. If a creature’s <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to <a href="SRD_Fascinated.html" title="SRD:Fascinated">fascinate</a> that creature again for 24 hours. If its <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> per bard level). While <a href="SRD_Fascinated.html" title="SRD:Fascinated">fascinated</a>, a target takes a –4 penalty on <a href="SRD_Skill_Check.html" title="SRD:Skill Check" class="mw-redirect">skill checks</a> made as reactions, such as <a href="SRD_Listen_Skill.html" title="SRD:Listen Skill">Listen</a> and <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html" title="SRD:Spot Skill">Spot</a> checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make another <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> check and allows the creature a new <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> against a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> equal to the new <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> check result.
</p><p>Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a <a href="SRD_Ranged_Weapon.html" title="SRD:Ranged Weapon">ranged weapon</a> at the target, automatically breaks the effect. <i><a href="SRD_Fascinated.html" title="SRD:Fascinated">Fascinate</a></i> is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.
</p><p><i><span id="Inspire_Courage">Inspire Courage</span> (<a href="SRD_Special_Abilities_Overview.html#Supernatural" title="SRD:Special Abilities Overview">Su</a>):</i> A bard with 3 or more ranks in a <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage in his allies (including himself), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throws</a> against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon <a href="SRD_Attack_Damage.html" title="SRD:Attack Damage">damage rolls</a>. At 8th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th). Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.
</p><p><i><span id="Inspire_Competence">Inspire Competence</span> (<a href="SRD_Special_Abilities_Overview.html#Supernatural" title="SRD:Special Abilities Overview">Su</a>):</i> A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> skill can use his music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The bard must also be able to see the ally.
</p><p>The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on <a href="SRD_Skill_Check.html" title="SRD:Skill Check" class="mw-redirect">skill checks</a> with a particular skill as long as he or she continues to hear the bard’s music. Certain uses of this ability are infeasible. The effect lasts as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard can’t inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence is a mind-affecting ability.
</p><p><i><span id="Suggestion">Suggestion</span> (<a href="SRD_Special_Abilities_Overview.html#Spell-Like" title="SRD:Special Abilities Overview">Sp</a>):</i> A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> skill can make a <a href="SRD_Suggestion.html" title="SRD:Suggestion">suggestion</a> (as the spell) to a creature that he has already <a href="SRD_Fascinated.html" title="SRD:Fascinated">fascinated</a> (see above). Using this ability does not break the bard’s concentration on the <i><a href="SRD_Fascinated.html" title="SRD:Fascinated">fascinate</a></i> effect, nor does it allow a second <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> against the <i><a href="SRD_Fascinated.html" title="SRD:Fascinated">fascinate</a></i> effect.
</p><p>Making a <a href="SRD_Suggestion.html" title="SRD:Suggestion">suggestion</a> doesn’t count against a bard’s daily limit on bardic music performances. A <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Will</a> <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 10 + 1/2 bard’s level + bard’s <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Cha</a> modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature (but see <i>mass suggestion</i>, below). <i>Suggestion</i> is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent ability.
</p><p><i><span id="Inspire_Greatness">Inspire Greatness</span> (<a href="SRD_Special_Abilities_Overview.html#Supernatural" title="SRD:Special Abilities Overview">Su</a>):</i> A bard of 9th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> skill can use music or poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally with a single use of this ability (two at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th). To inspire greatness, a bard must sing and an ally must hear him sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">Hit Dice</a> (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> (apply the target’s <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Consitution</a> modifier, if any, to these bonus <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">Hit Dice</a>), a +2 competence bonus on <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack rolls</a>, and a +1 competence bonus on <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> saves. The bonus <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">Hit Dice</a> count as regular <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">Hit Dice</a> for determining the effect of spells that are <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">Hit Dice</a> dependant. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability.
</p><p><i><span id="Song_of_Freedom">Song of Freedom</span> (<a href="SRD_Special_Abilities_Overview.html#Spell-Like" title="SRD:Special Abilities Overview">Sp</a>):</i> A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> skill can use music or poetics to create an effect equivalent to the <a href="SRD_Break_Enchantment.html" title="SRD:Break Enchantment">break enchantment</a> spell (<a href="SRD_Caster_Level.html" title="SRD:Caster Level" class="mw-redirect">caster level</a> equals the character’s bard level). Using this ability requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration and music, and it functions on a single target within 30 feet. A bard can’t use <i>song of freedom</i> on himself.
</p><p><i><span id="Inspire_Heroics">Inspire Heroics</span> (<a href="SRD_Special_Abilities_Overview.html#Supernatural" title="SRD:Special Abilities Overview">Su</a>):</i> A bard of 15th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> skill can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear the bard sing for a full <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. A creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throws</a> and a +4 dodge bonus to <a href="SRD_AC.html" title="SRD:AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a>. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability.
</p><p><i><span id="Mass_Suggestion">Mass Suggestion</span> (<a href="SRD_Special_Abilities_Overview.html#Spell-Like" title="SRD:Special Abilities Overview">Sp</a>):</i> This ability functions like <i><a href="SRD_Suggestion.html" title="SRD:Suggestion">suggestion</a>,</i> above, except that a bard of 18th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a <a href="SRD_Perform_Skill.html" title="SRD:Perform Skill">Perform</a> skill can make the <a href="SRD_Suggestion.html" title="SRD:Suggestion">suggestion</a> simultaneously to any number of creatures that he has already <a href="SRD_Fascinated.html" title="SRD:Fascinated">fascinated</a> (see above). <i>mass suggestion</i> is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.
