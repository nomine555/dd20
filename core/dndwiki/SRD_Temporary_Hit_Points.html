<p>Certain effects give a character temporary <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>. When a character gains temporary <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>, note his current hit point total. When the temporary <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> go away the character’s <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> drop to his current hit point total. If the character’s <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> are below his current hit point total at that time, all the temporary <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> have already been lost and the character’s hit point total does not drop further.
</p><p>When temporary <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> are lost, they cannot be restored as real <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> can be, even by magic.

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Increases_in_Constitution_Score_and_Current_Hit_Points">Increases in <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a> Score and Current <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">Hit Points</a></span></h5>
<p>An increase in a character’s <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a> score, even a temporary one, can give her more <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> (an effective hit point increase), but these are not temporary <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>. They can be restored and they are not lost first as temporary <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> are.
