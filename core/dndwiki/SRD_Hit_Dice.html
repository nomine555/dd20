<p>This line gives the creature’s number and type of Hit Dice, and lists any bonus <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>. A parenthetical note gives the average <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> for a creature of the indicated number of Hit Dice. A creature’s Hit Dice total is also treated as its level for determining how spells affect the creature, its rate of natural healing, and its maximum ranks in a skill.
