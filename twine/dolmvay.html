# GUIDEBOOK TO THE CITY OF DOLMVAY

&gt; &quot;The world is but a canvas to our imagination.&quot;  
&gt; —Henry David Thoreau

### How to Use This Book

The *Guidebook to the City of Dolmvay* is a *5th edition* supplement
for the *Chronicles of Amherth™* campaign setting that details the
people, layout, and government of the City of Dolmvay. The city is
presented in broad strokes and is open to customization. It was
specifically designed to give DM&#39;s a convenient and familiar
city setting to place their adventures.

### Making it Your Own

The version of Dolmvay presented in this text is set in the low-magic,
low-fantasy *Chronicles of Amherth™* campaign setting. Humans are the
dominant race in the city. Demihumans are a distinct minority that are
subject to various levels of curiosity, prejudice, and mistrust. Think
of an African tribesman wandering the streets of medieval London or the
entourage of a Japanese samurai visiting Rome during the Italian
Renaissance. They might draw stares and whispers, but they would not be
immediately hated and reviled.

Conversely, magic is uncommon and those who practice it are often
feared. Religion, particularly the teachings of the Church of Law and
Order, plays a prominent role in the lives of every citizen. Although
the Church is largely considered a driving force for good, past scandals
and corruption have marred its perfect image.

Amherth is scaled for low-level play and the party should rarely
encounter an NPC of 9th level or higher. This means the characters have
a real chance to affect the world around them (for good or ill). This
also means that DM&#39;s who prefer a more high fantasy style of
play where magic is routine and powerful NPCs are common may have to
increase the scale of some encounters.

## Things to Remember
The following themes are important to keep in mind when running
adventures in the City of Dolmvay.

### The City is Ancient
The City of Dolmvay is built upon the ruins of several older cities,
most notably the ancient City of Vay whose history is shrouded in myth
and legend. Crumbling old buildings, vine-covered walls, and worn
cobblestone streets all combine to give Dolmvay a sense of age, even
amidst newer construction. The city and the magical warren of sewers
beneath it are rumored to hold a number of forgotten secrets.

### Law and Order
The Church of Law and Order is the dominant religion in Dolmvay and its
presence is evident throughout the city. Holy days are strictly
observed, church bells call the faithful to worship, and neighborhood
statues, fountains, and frescoes depict various saints and other
religious motifs. Prayers and rituals are part of everyday life—a
Watchman might whisper a prayer of protection to the forces of Law and
Order before starting a patrol, a shopkeeper might make a sacrifice to
St. Gregor of Carach for good business, and a mother might beg St.
Lucilla the Kind to heal her sick child. The clergy can be seen
everywhere and are a constant reminder to the citizens that their city
is a bastion of Law and Order.

### Power Struggles
In Dolmvay, the noble houses, wealthy merchant families, and trade
guilds all vie with each other for power and influence. Some seek to
curry favor with the royal family, others seek to earn (or buy) the
goodwill of the Church, while others focus on winning the hearts and
minds of the citizens. The Duke traditionally avoids these power
struggles, but members of his inner council sometimes pursue their own
agendas. One thing is certain—nothing in Dolmvay is free and a favor
granted must be repaid.

### Magic is Feared
As with other places in Amherth, magic is common enough to be accepted
as part of the norm, however, those who practice magic are rarely
trusted by the populace. The Church of Law and Order has played upon
these fears even further to paint magic-users and other spellcasters as
despicable sorcerers who are easily converted to the Church of Chaos and
Destruction. Magic-users are expected to register with the Adventurer&#39;s
Guild and are subject to close scrutiny by agents of the Church of Law
and Order. Demihumans, particularly elves, are considered creatures of
magic and are therefore not to be entirely trusted.

### Adventurers are Heroes
The *Guidebook to the City of Dolmvay* embraces the concept of the
Adventurer&#39;s Guild where adventurers, like any other craftsmen or
tradesmen, may hone their skills, network with colleagues, and seek
employment.

Adventuring is a time-honored profession throughout the Duchy of
Valnwall and adventurers are afforded a special celebrity status that
transcends the normal social classes. This status rises and falls with
the adventurer&#39;s fame and fortune. Although a nobleman may secretly look
down upon an adventurer of common birth, the adventurer can still expect
to be treated as a near equal, provided his deeds have been immortalized
in poetry and song.

Adventurers are expected to assist the City Watch when needed, drive off
monsters, and generally help keep the citizens of Dolmvay safe. The
greatest adventurers may be awarded knighthoods, land grants, and even
noble titles.

Demihuman adventurers, particularly dwarves, are better received than
their non-adventuring counterparts, but may still suffer from prejudice
and distrust until they prove themselves through Lawful deeds.
Demihumans who belong to famous adventuring companies may eventually win
the admiration and respect of the people of Dolmvay (if that is their
desire). </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Adventuring in Dolmvay" tags="index @adventuring-in-dolmvay" position="139,461" size="100,100">
# ADVENTURING IN DOLMVAY

&gt; &quot;Fortune Favors the Bold!&quot;  
&gt; —common adventurer&#39;s toast

The City of Dolmvay is a bustling port city that is ripe for adventure.
Here, adventurers may find routine work guarding caravans, ships, shops,
or homes, or even serve as bodyguards for wealthy patrons.

The city&#39;s image as a bastion of Law and Order is a thin veneer that
hides a thriving criminal underworld. Plotting and intrigue are common
throughout Dolmvay. At the upper levels, the nobles, guilds, and
merchant families constantly vie for power in the royal court.
Adventurers may be hired to deliver messages, disrupt competing
operations, or even kidnap or assassinate rivals. At the lower levels,
adventurers may be drawn into conflicts with the broklaw gangs who vie
for control of the city&#39;s streets.

The Church of Law and Order sometimes hires Lawful and Neutral
adventurers to assist the clergy with its quest to root out dissidents
and expose worshipers of false gods. Adventurers may also be contracted
to provide extra security during holiday celebrations and religious
festivals.

The sewer system beneath the city is driven by ancient magic and is full
of hidden passages, crypts, and monsters. These monsters sometimes creep
into the city to harass and threaten citizens. Adventurers seeking less
mundane adventures may be contracted by the Sewerman&#39;s Guild to verify
or update maps of Dolmvay&#39;s ever-changing sewer system.

Adventurers are commonly called upon to assist the City Watch.
Adventurers have also been known to hire out to politicians or members
of the Ducal Council. The most powerful adventuring companies may even
be commissioned by the Duke to undertake adventures in his name.

## Adventurer&#39;s Guild
All adventurers are required to join the Adventurer&#39;s Guild. Those who
do not may be treated as trespassers, grave robbers, and even wandering
murderers. The Dolmvay Adventurer&#39;s Guild is located on the [[Isle of
Heroes]].

A number of named adventuring companies operate in the City of Dolmvay
and throughout the Duchy of Valnwall. The characters are free to join
one of these companies or develop their own. A few of the most famous
adventuring companies are noted below.

### Wardens
The Wardens are an adventuring company that hires out as guards to
various citizens and organizations of Dolmvay. The Wardens are divided
into the Northwardens who specialize in guarding the wealthy residents
of the North Ward, and the Southwardens who specialize in protecting
neighborhoods, shops, and guildworks of the South Ward. The Wardens&#39;
standard is a rose compass—the Northwardens compass points North while
the Southwardens compass points south.

### Urban Delvers
The Urban Delvers specialize in exploring the city&#39;s vast sewer system,
slaying subterranean monsters, and uncovering hidden ruins beneath the
city. The Delvers are trained to be strong swimmers and are accustomed
to operating in confined spaces. The Delvers were founded by dwarves and
welcome demihumans into their ranks.

### Company of the Wall
The Company of the Wall are the only adventurers who are legally allowed
to explore the ancient seawall aand megadungeon known as the Great
Valnwall. The Company of the Wall is one of the wealthiest companies in
Dolmvay and its members are well trained and well equipped. Their
standard is the stylized silhouette of the Great Valnwall.

**Note:** The Great Valnwall will be further described in the future
Small Niche Games campaign supplement *Guidebook to the Duchy of
Valnwall*.

### Knights of Mor
The Knights of Mor specialize in exploration of the ruined City of Mor.
The members in Dolmvay act primarily as recruiters who entice wide-eyed
youths with dreams of untold fame and fortune to be found in the ruins
of the Great City. These new recruits are hastily trained, poorly
equipped, and then shipped off to be used as fodder for more experienced
Knights based in the town of Lesserton\*. Their standard is the stylized
silhouette of a gleaming city.

\*see the Faster Monkey Games adventure supplement *Lesserton and Mor*.

### Gulf Sail Society
The Gulf Sail Society is an adventuring company that specializes in
water-based adventures throughout the Gulf of Valnwall. Gulf Sailers
have a seedy reputation and some of its members have been hanged for
piracy. The Gulf Sail standard is a trio of triangular sails.

## Adventure Themes

Adventures are formed by conflicts, and the City of Dolmvay is
intentionally written with a number of built-in conflicts to explore.
DM&#39;s can use the following themes to design new adventures or
even build entire campaigns around these conflicts.

### Church
This is an easy one. Religion can bring peace and happiness to a lot of
people. It can also be viewed as a major source of oppression and a way
to control the masses. As with any large and powerful organization,
corruption, infighting, and intrigue seem to go hand in hand. Clergymen
may plot to shame, depose, or even kill their rivals. Outside forces and
rival religious factions may target church functions, defile holy sites,
and even murder clergymen in an effort to undermine the church&#39;s power
and influence.

### Guilds
The guilds were created to set prices, broker deals, and generally make
life better for their members. Not all members are considered equal,
however, and some seek only to exploit other guildsmen for their own
personal gain. Plots to vandalize rival shops, disrupt deliveries, and
steal wealthy clients are common. Guildworks factories can also be a
constant source of problems, with apprentices earning low wages,
competing for jobs, and toiling away in unsafe working conditions.

### Merchant Families
The merchant families of Dolmvay have skillfully maneuvered their way
into the city&#39;s upper class. This has caused friction with the poorer
commoners who feel the merchants have &quot;forgotten where they came from&quot;
as well as the Dolmvay noble houses who feel much the same way, but for
different reasons. The merchant families constantly plot to expand their
wealth and influence. These intrigues often involve schemes to
discredit, embarrass, and even murder members of rival families. On rare
occasions, powerful families may engage in open conflict until a truce
is negotiated (or ordered by the Duke).

### Noble Houses
The noble houses of Dolmvay once had free reign of the city and many
still feel their rights are greater than that of the common man. This
attitude has earned them few friends among those of lesser station. The
noble houses constantly seek to outdo one another and their intrigues
often resemble that of the rival merchant families. This rivalry is
especially bitter between nobles who trace their lineage to the ancient
houses of Vay and Mor. Honor duels are commonly fought and skilled
champions are highly prized.

### Economics
The enmity between poor man and rich man is subdued, but has existed far
longer than any other form of strife in the city. Poverty tends to breed
hardship, crime, and envy of those with wealth. It can also build
character in those who manage to rise above their station. Wealth tends
to breed complacency, laziness, and contempt for the poor. It can also
generate some of the greatest acts of kindness and charity from those
who have the will and the means to help others in need. Conflict between
the poor and the wealthy can be motivated by basic needs (such as
hunger), indifference, or selfish desires (such as greed).

### Royalty
The Dukes of Dolm have ruled Dolmvay since the city&#39;s inception,
however, this rule has not gone uncontested. The Duke and his family
live each day knowing that they have been marked for death. Noble houses
and merchant families conspire with usurpers to overthrow the line of
Dolm. Assassins lurk around every corner, promising death in the form of
a knife in the back, an arrow in the dark, or a poisoned glass of wine.
Dissident factions such as the Order of Karth, the Church of Chaos and
Destruction, and the Society of the Swan seek to bring about the city&#39;s
downfall. With help from its allies and the Church of Law and Order, the
royal family has managed to persevere.

### Criminal Underworld
Dolmvay&#39;s criminal underworld is alive and well. Guild thieves break
into the homes of the rich and steal objects of incalculable wealth.
Broklaw gangs extort the common folk and war with each other for control
of their territories, often engaging in violent, bloody battles in the
streets. More nefarious factions such as Chaos priests and inhuman
monsters seek only to prey upon the innocent. The City Watch is often
the only thing that stands between criminals and total anarchy. It is
little wonder then that Lawful adventurers are welcomed and expected to
help keep peace throughout the city.

### Humans vs. Demihumans
In Dolmvay, the prejudice between humans and demihumans is widespread.
To a human, elves are creatures of magic and therefore never to be fully
trusted; dwarves are tolerated and even sometimes shown a grudging
respect; the stunted creatures known as halflings are simply objects of
sympathy or ridicule.

To a demihuman, humans are arrogant, vain, and deceitful—ham-handed
brutes who have neither the intelligence nor skill to develop more than
a rudimentary form of civilization. Complicating matters further,
demihumans often have their own prejudices, with elves and dwarves
considering themselves superior to one another, and both feeling
themselves above the lowly halflings.

### Sewers
The sewers of Dolmvay are ripe (no pun intended) for exploration and
adventure. Various monsters prowl its deepest, darkest passages. Lost
dungeons, secret lairs, and hidden chambers hold wealth and knowledge of
the past. An entire campaign can be centered around trying to harness
the magic of the Ancients. Intrepid adventurers should be forewarned,
however. The magic of the Ancients is wild and unpredictable and
tampering with artifacts beyond their understanding may have dire
consequences for the city above.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Ancient History" tags="index @ancient-history" position="258,462" size="100,100">
# ANCIENT HISTORY

&gt; &quot;The Time of the Thirteen Cities was an age undreamed of on Amherth.
&gt; It is easy then, to forget that civilizations existed long before the
&gt; first fire pit was dug on the banks of the Dolm River. And that not
&gt; all of these civilizations were human...&quot;  
&gt; —Atarin the Sage

In ages past, the great city-states of Amherth rose to power during what
was known as the Time of the Thirteen Cities. This was an era of myth,
magic, and miracles—a Golden Age of civilization, innovation, and
prosperity where anything seemed possible. Alas, one-by-one, these great
city-states fell into ruin and memory until now, only their legends
remain.

### The Great Cities of Amalor
On the continent of Amalor, the three Great Cities of Aal, Vay, and Mor
reigned supreme. The City of Aal was a mythical kingdom of master
builders who artfully blended magic with science to create items,
structures, and golems that defied logic, performed mundane tasks, and
could even think and act on their own. It is said that this magic
ultimately led to their undoing when these creations turned upon their
masters and unleashed a wave of destruction that left the once-beautiful
Kingdom of Aal a wasteland where only evil dwells.

The City of Mor was renowned for its mystics and sorcerers. It is said
these men spent most of their lives in a trancelike state, exploring the
ancient mysteries of other planes of existence. This apathy towards the
mortal world became their greatest weakness, as the forces of an evil
warlord known as the Halfruk Lord descended on the Great City of Mor
from the Ruklands to the north. The sorcerers of Mor called upon ancient
magics to defend the city, but this dark sorcery proved to be their
undoing, and the Great City of Mor became a twisted ruin, tainted by
foul magics.

### The City of Vay
The City of Vay (pr. Vay or Vai) was built upon faith and just laws. It
was the birthplace of the legendary hero Valen as well as the Church of
Law and Order that was founded upon his death. According to legend,
crime was almost unheard of in Vay, and a wealthy man could carry a sack
of gold from one end of the city to the other in the darkest hours of
the night without fear of being robbed.

Like its sister cities, however, Vay&#39;s star eventually darkened and
fell. After the City of Aal became a wasteland and the City of Mor was
brought down by magic and invaders, Vay, the last of the great
city-states of Amalor, closed its gates to outsiders and sheathed itself
in faith and piety. This insulation led to corruption, infighting, and
an internal civil war that decimated the population. The Church of Law
and Order eventually prevailed over the forces of evil, but by then the
once-great City of Vay had become only a shadow of its former glory.

### Timeline
The Time of the Thirteen Cities existed during a mythical age whose
records have been lost to time. All that remains are songs, legends,
ruins, and ancient artifacts from this wondrous era. Historians insist
that the Golden Age of the Great Cities reached its peak thousands, if
not tens of thousands of years ago, and that many of the strange
artifacts that turn up today are from civilizations that came before or
followed after.

However, the legends of the Great Cities are so ingrained in modern
culture that the common folk speak as if they existed within the past
few hundred years. The deeds of legendary heroes of that age (St. Valen,
St. Poul, St. Raymont, etc.) are spoken of so casually that an outsider
might think they were hearing heroic tales of recent events. This is
because the common citizens of Dolmvay are more interested in acts of
courage and valor than the details of when such stories actually took
place.

### The Dukes of Dolm
Countless years later, during the time known as the Age of Might, the
petty kings of western Herth sought to colonize and expand their power
on the continent of Amalor. At this time, the City of Vay had been long
in decline and the wildlands of Amalor were ripe for adventure, filled
with lost ruins, savage monsters, and untold treasures. The people of
Amalor were divided, and chafed under the rule of oppressive religious
orders and ancient noble houses who reveled in family names and past
glories.

Willhelm the Duke of Dolm, a vassal of King Herek of the Kingdom of
Might, was one of many nobles sent to settle Amalor. His ships made port
in the ruins of the ancient city of Vay where he met with the ragged
emissaries of the Church of Law and Order who still ruled there. It is
said the priests looked into Willhelm&#39;s heart (some say his coffers) and
declared him a blessing sent by the mighty St. Valen of Vay.

Duke Willhelm Dolm restored the ruins of Vay and the city was renamed
Dolmvay in his honor. The Duke claimed the lands north of the Great
Valnwall in the name of King Herek and quickly set about taming the
countryside. His armies built roads and fortresses along the major
rivers and pushed back the tribes of nonhumans that had flourished since
the fall of the Great Cities.

An arranged marriage between the Duke and the Lady Morgan of the
powerful noble house of mor Seronand helped cement his claim to rule.
Other alliances were forged through marriages, favors, and threats,
bringing the petty kings and ancient noble houses of Vay and Mor under
King Herek&#39;s banner, and the people flourished.

The Church of Law and Order grew in power during this time and, with the
Duke&#39;s support, its teachings began to spread to the lands across the
sea, particularly the merchant kingdom of Guildeland.

When King Herek was slain by the forces of Xanne during the War of
Crows, Duke Willhelm was forced to swear fealty to the Immortal Zaer von
Xanne and accommodate the Grand Emperor&#39;s demands. During this time, the
Duke established strong ties with the noble houses and merchant families
of Guildeland.

When the War of Hope erupted, the Duke secretly sent wealth, weapons,
and supplies to help the Army of Hope break the Empire&#39;s hold on western
Herth, forever establishing the Duchy of Valnwall as a champion of Law
and Order.

Duke Willhelm has long since passed but, with the support of the church
and the people, the line of Dolm has weathered several hundred years of
wars, uprisings, and internal strife to remain in power as the rulers of
Dolmvay and the Duchy of Valnwall.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="City of Dolmvay" tags="index @city-of-dolmvay" position="23,573" size="100,100">
# CITY OF DOLMVAY

&gt; &quot;And for the crime of child murder, I sentence you, Robert Wintor, to
&gt; execution in St. Raymont&#39;s Square!&quot;  
&gt; —Judge Tomas Edwards of Oldcastle

The City of Dolmvay, also known as the White City and the City by the
Sea, is the shining capital of the Duchy of Valnwall and a bastion of
light in the civilized world. Dolmvay was built upon the ruins of the
Great City of Vay and was founded during the Age of Might. It is the
largest city in the Duchy of Valnwall with a population of approximately
70,000 citizens, with half as many visitors present on any given day.

## Government
Dolmvay is the seat of ducal power. The Duke of Valnwall is technically
a vassal of King Herek, however, no child of Herek&#39;s line is believed to
have survived the War of Hope. This means the Duke is free to rule the
Duchy of Valnwall as he sees fit, and some in fact have called for him
to be crowned its king.

The Duke is closely advised by the Ducal Council—a combination of
elected and appointed officials who advise the Duke on important
matters, set policies, and handle daily procedures. Although the Duke
has the final say in all matters of state, very few policies are made
without the approval of the Church of Law and Order. The Duke is well
aware that the church has the support of the common folk, and it is the
common folk who comprise the majority of Dolmvay&#39;s citizens.

## Standard
The Duchy of Valnwall’s standard is the black silhouette of a crown
above a stylized silhouette of the Great Valnwall. These silhouettes are
outlined in gold and set upon a dark green background. The standard of
the City of Dolmvay is a stylized D inside the silhouette of the Great
Valnwall, flanked by three holy hilts of Law and Order. Each earl,
baron, knight, noble house, merchant family, and guild also possesses
their own identifying colors and symbols.

## Religion
The Church of Law and Order is the dominant religion in Dolmvay and
throughout the Duchy of Valnwall. Its political arm constantly tries to
influence policies and stamp out the worship of other gods, especially
that of its opposition, the Church of Chaos and Destruction (Jesil).

The Xannen Gods of Amherth are worshipped by a few select nobles, but
these worshipers can expect to be treated with prejudice. An ancient and
secretive nature religion known as the Druun (pr. DREW-un) has been
suppressed for centuries, but many commoners still pay homage to its
folk rituals, customs, and beliefs.

## Laws and Punishment
Whether by accident or design, adventurers sometimes end up on the wrong
side of the law. Characters should be aware that Dolmvay is not some
lawless dungeon where disputes can be settled with a bolt of lightning
or the slash of a sword.

Dolmvay is the birthplace of the Church of Law and Order and most of its
citizens are honest, law-abiding men and women. However, crimes occur on
a daily basis, especially in the poorer neighborhoods. The City Watch
has the authority to arrest anyone in the vicinity of an alleged crime.

Otherwise, anyone has the right to bring a grievance to the City Watch
before or after a crime has been committed. The Watch Sergeant on duty
then assesses the situation and determines what action to take (if any).

Those arrested spend 1d6 days jailed at the local Watchpost awaiting
trial. Trials are conducted at the District Watchpost before a single
judge. Judges are appointed by the Church of Law and Order from a pool
of senior Watchmen. Their rulings tend to lean heavily in the favor of
the church&#39;s teachings. Although most judges are honorable, upstanding
citizens, a few have grown drunk with their own power and become
susceptible to bribery and corruption.

For crimes other than murder, piracy, or treason, an alman from the
Alman&#39;s Guild can arrange bail for a small fee. Almen may also be hired
to present a case and/or arrange bribes (when applicable). Nobles,
politicians, and other wealthy citizens and organizations (such as the
Adventurer’s Guild) may also use their clout and influence to obtain an
early release from jail, although the criminal is still expected to
attend trial.

What follows is a basic list of crimes and punishments in Dolmvay.

|Crime|Punishment|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|  
|Debt|1d3 years indentured servitude or until debt is paid|
|Guild Evasion|1d6 x 100 gp fine and/or 1d6 years indentured servitude|
|Disturbing the Peace|1d6 gp fine and/or 1 day in jail and/or 1 day public incarceration|
|Damage to Property|1d6 x 5 gp fine and/or 1d6 days in jail and/or 1d3 days public incarceration|
|Theft or Fraud|1d6 x 10 gp fine and/or 1d6 days in jail and/or 1d6 days public incarceration|
|Assault (unarmed) or Extortion|1d6 gp fine and/or 1d6 days in jail and/or 1 day public incarceration|
|Assault (armed)|1d6 x 100 gp fine and/or 1d6 x 3 months in jail and/or 1d6 days public incarceration|
|Assault on a Watchman or Clergyman|1d6 x 20 gp fine and/or 1d6 x 5 days in jail and/or 1d6 x 5 days public incarceration|
|Insolence to a Noble|Public flogging|
|Murder or Piracy|Execution or public execution or public torture and execution|
|Treason|Public execution or public torture and execution|

**Note:** Murder and assault charges do not include those that occur in
self-defense. Fines and punishments may be doubled if the offender is
also a member of a broklaw gang. Fines and punishments may be tripled if
magic is involved in the commission of the crime.

The following punishments may be imposed on criminals in Dolmvay. The
severity of punishments listed above are meant to be used as guidelines.
Fines and jail time tend to increase incrementally with each offense,
and may go well beyond the listed amounts.

### Fines
Fines are the most common form of punishment for crimes in Dolmvay. Any
fines for theft, fraud, damage to property, and debt take place after
the victim has been paid back. Payment of fines is expected upon
sentencing, although the judge may allow the offender to remain in jail
for up to 1d3 weeks while he arranges payment. Those who cannot pay a
fine or restitution are found guilty of debt.

### Indentured Servitude
Human slavery is illegal in the Duchy of Valnwall. However, indentured
servitude is an accepted method of paying off debts. Indentured servants
may be put to work in city-owned mines, logging camps, crop fields, or
aboard ships unless they demonstrate some other more useful skill (such
as adventuring!).

### Public Incarceration
Public incarceration involves being caged or put in stocks in a public
square (usually in the neighborhood where the crime was committed). The
criminal is then subject to be ridiculed, pelted with offal and garbage,
and suffer other forms of abuse from local law-abiding citizens.

### Jail
Jail time is spent in the local Watchpost, in the dungeons of Oldcastle,
or in the dungeons of the Ducal Palace, depending on the location of the
crime, the severity of the offense, and the history of the offender. The
judge usually counts time served waiting for trial as part of the
sentence.

### Flogging
Flogging involves being tied to a public whipping post and suffering
2d20 lashes. However, no one in Dolmvay has been convicted of insolence
to a noble in many years, and many believe such an outdated charge would
only lead to civil unrest.

### Public Torture and Execution
Although executions take place monthly, public torture and execution by
beheading are reserved for the most heinous criminals and crimes. They
are most often held at Oldcastle, the Ducal Palace, and occasionally the
Valenon. Public executions are attended by people from all over the
city. The more infamous the criminal, the more popular the event.

### Trial by Combat
One holdover from Dolmvay&#39;s past is a noble&#39;s right to trial by combat.
A noble convicted of piracy, murder, or treason may appoint a champion
to defend his honor. The judge or other presiding official (such as a
Lawlord or the Duke) selects a champion to represent the court.

These honor duels are typically fought to the death, although quarter
may be given if asked (at great dishonor to the loser). Agents of the
church oversee these duels to ensure that no magic is used to sway the
outcome. If the champion is defeated, the noble is considered guilty
beyond doubt and is sentenced to death by public torture and execution.

## Commerce
The City of Dolmvay is a bustling port city that sees trade from all
over Amherth.

Commerce in Dolmvay is heavily influenced by the guilds and merchant
families. Large privately owned guild operations (such as tanneries,
breweries, mines, granaries, gristmills, fish factories, cloth mills,
shipyards, slaughterhouses, stockyards, wineries, etc.) are known as
guildworks. Guildworks can employ hundreds of laborers, most of whom
work for low pay in unpleasant conditions. Almost all guildworks are
confined to the Guild District or are located outside the city walls.

Smaller shop operations (such as leatherworkers, taverns, butchers,
livestock sellers, etc.) are practiced by guildsmen at the local level.
Most of these merchants and craftsmen reside in apartments above their
shops, however, wealthier shop owners may have other accommodations.

Street vendors hawk their wares from the street, carrying items for sale
on their person, in pushcarts, or even blankets laid out on the
sidewalk. Street vendors may practice any type of craft or sell any type
of goods. Many street vendors are not guild members and must avoid
harassment by local guildsmen.

A number of guilds work in conjunction with one another (such as the
Slaughterhousers Guild and the Butchers Guild or the Guild of Tanners
and the Leatherworker&#39;s Guild), but rivalry between guilds and even
within guilds is common, especially when similar shops and guildworks
are located nearby.

### Currency
The Xannen gold emperor, silver empire, and copper slave\* are the most
commonly accepted forms of currency in Dolmvay. Antique coins from the
ruined cities of Aal, Mor, and Vay are also found in circulation.
Foreign coins are weighed for their value. In some cases, barter is also
an acceptable method of trade. The Duchy of Valnwall does not currently
mint its own coinage, although several guilds have petitioned the Duke
to consider this matter.

\*see the *Chronicles of Amherth™* campaign setting for more information
about these coins.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Calendar" tags="index @calendar" position="140,573" size="100,100">
# CALENDAR

&gt; &quot;Welcome friends! Eat and drink and drink some more! We must honor the
&gt; saint with another round!&quot;  
&gt; —Brother Ellis Montrall during the Festival of the Harvest

The people of Dolmvay use the standard Xannen calendar to keep track of
time. A year consists of twelve months—Janur, Febron, Marcus, Arbel,
Mairi, Junae, Julae, Augrast, Septem, Octubrast, Novem, and Dechem—and
each month has roughly 30 days. A week consists of seven days—Modan,
Todas, Wedna, Throde, Frida, Sadat, and Son&#39;s Day, which is considered a
holy day of St. Valen.

## Major Festivals
Festivals are a common occurrence in the City of Dolmvay, with small
carnivals, religious celebrations, and neighborhood fairs seeming to
take place every other week or so. These festivals are usually centered
in or around the main marketplaces.

The major festivals celebrated throughout Dolmvay are listed below. They
involve sporting games (stone lifting, foot and horse races, wrestling,
duels, jousts, archery contests, etc.), storytelling, music, and dances.
During these festivals, designated streets are blocked off to allow only
foot traffic and the price of alcohol is halved.

### The Feast of St. Johanna the Maiden of Battle
Johanna of Ethelstan was a legendary figure who lived hundreds of years
ago. According to the story, she was a soldier’s wife whose home was
attacked by ruk raiders while her husband was away. Johanna defended her
family for three nights and slew dozens of ruks before succumbing to her
wounds. St. Johanna is prayed to for protection and is the Patron Saint
of Women and Children in Need. The festival begins on the first week in
Febron and lasts for three nights.

### The Feast of St. Valen
St. Valen of Vay was the founder of the modern incarnation of the Church
of Law and Order. He was said to be a champion of justice and a hero to
the weak and oppressed.

The Feast of St. Valen takes place on the first day of Marcus and lasts
throughout the month. To honor St. Valen, the High Lawlord gives public
services from the balcony of the Cathedral of St. Poul and the Duke of
Valnwall and his retinue travel across the Duchy to personally hold
court, hear cases, and dispense justice.

Trials for the most heinous crimes, such as treason, are held during the
last week of Marcus. Children born during the month of Marcus are
believed to be destined for greatness in the church. Valen is the Patron
Saint of Truth, Justice, Law, and Order.

### King’s Day
This festival traditionally celebrates the birthday of King Herek of the
fallen Kingdom of Might. It is a weeklong celebration that begins on the
19th day of Arbel and is marked by feasting, drinking, and merriment.
The King&#39;s Day festival is famous for a daily melee, thrown weapon, and
mounted combat tourney. All participants must wield some form of axe,
which was the favored weapon of King Herek.

At the end of the week, the winner of the tourney is honored in a lavish
ceremony. The tournament was once held at the Ducal Palace, but has
grown so large that it now takes place in the Dolmvay Coliseum.

### The Festival of Spring

The Festival of Spring takes place on the first day of Mairi and is a
celebration of life and rebirth.

Single men dress in their finest clothing. They supply all food in order
to demonstrate their ability to be good providers, and hopefully impress
young women for the Festival of the Planting. Women travel into the
fields and meadows to collect wildflowers which are worn on clothes or
hung as decorations. Friends and relatives give children small gifts and
other tokens.

Betrothal announcements are common during the Festival of Spring and
homage is paid to St. Mari of Galask, the Patron Saint of Hearth and
Home. A child born during this festival is considered a good omen who is
destined to bring honor to the family name.

### The Festival of the Planting 
This festival is held in hopes of a good harvest and takes place after
all the crops have been sown, usually near the beginning of summer in
the month of Junae. The celebration involves much dancing, singing, and
flirting. Homage is paid to St. Leandra the Lady of Blossoms, the Patron
Saint of Life and Fertility. Although the church frowns on overt acts of
affection, promiscuity among married couples is encouraged which is why
many children are born months later during the Feast of St. Valen.

### Festival of St. Meschil

The Festival of St. Meschil takes place on the last three days of Junae.
It is a harmonious festival of rebirth that involves singing, dancing,
and games of mental skill (such as castles). Those suffering from mental
illnesses and mind-affecting spells come from all over to attend these
festivals and pray to be healed by the Church of Law and Order. The
clergymen select one person by lottery to be healed in this manner. The
festival is most famous for the nightly Dance of the Visionarres, which
is said to heal the mind and bring peace to troubled souls.

### The Feast of St. Poul of the Shield
According to legends, Poul was a murderer and a brigand who was captured
by St. Valen and given a chance to renounce his evil ways and follow the
path of Law and Order. Poul became one of the church’s most devout and
effective holy warriors and Valen&#39;s right-hand man.

The story of St. Poul is used to teach worshipers that even the most
vile being can be brought back into the Light. The Feast of St. Poul of
the Shield is a weeklong event that begins on the 1st day of Julae.
During this time, criminals and outlaws are allowed to petition the
church—all charges and hostilities against them may be dropped in
exchange for loyal service as an acolyte. The penalty for future
disloyalty is torture and death.

St. Poul is the Patron Saint of Warriors, especially Lawful fighters,
city guardsmen, and reformed criminals.

### Liberation Day
This festival is mainly celebrated in Dolmvay. It takes place in the
middle of summer, during the second week of Julae, marking the Army of
Hope’s victory over the Empire of Xanne. It is a merry celebration of
nationalism and pride where flags and standards bearing the Duchy of
Valnwall and Republic of Westport banners are flown, carried, or sewn
onto clothes.

It is a day of great feasting, drinking, and gift giving. White armbands
and headbands are worn as a symbol of hope and freedom. On this day,
soldiers eat and drink for free and many are invited to attend
extravagant parties thrown by the wealthy. At midnight, scarecrows
representing the Immortal Emperor Zaer von Xanne are burned in effigy.

### Festival of St. Aleena
The festival of St. Aleena is a glorious week-long event that begins in
the third week of Augrast. The festival is marked by a huge public
tournament between guild-licensed adventuring companies. The tournament
takes place in the Dolmvay coliseum and involves individual
class-oriented duels and challenges as well as competitions between
entire adventuring companies.

The festival is hosted by the Dolmvay Adventurer&#39;s Guild. The
contestants are broken up into ranges of skill levels: Journeyman
(1st-3rd), Master (3rd-5th), Heroic (5th-7th), and Epic (7th+), and
perform in front of a crowd of thousands. Prizes are awarded to
victorious adventurers and their companies, however, most adventurers
are just happy to receive the title of Champion of St. Aleena.

The tournament is free to attend and a simple meal of bread and watered
down wine is provided to spectators. (Vendors may apply for permits to
sell concessions, toys, and other items in the stands or coliseum
arcades.) The results of these contests, the more ostentatious
adventurers, and the greatest feats of strength and skill are discussed
and argued for weeks, months, and even years later.

### The Festival of the Harvest
This festival celebrates a fruitful harvest and the hope of a mild
winter. It takes place after all the crops have been reaped from the
fields, usually near the beginning of autumn in the first week of
Septem. The festival is marked by lavish feasts, drunkenness, and eating
contests in honor of St. Ronnad of the Flagon.

### The Feast of St. Garan
The Feast of St. Garan is an annual, five-day event commemorating Sir
Tormic Garan’s victory over the evil lords who once ruled much of the
surrounding lands. The festival ends in the month of Octubrast on the
night of the Blood Moon, also known as the Hunter’s Moon, which marks
the first full moon after the fall harvest. St. Garan is the Patron
Saint of Warriors.

The Feast of St. Garan is fully detailed in the Small Niche Games
adventure *Blood Moon Rising*.

### Ancestor Night
Ancestor Night is a celebration of those who have passed on. It takes
place during autumn on the last day of Octubrast. Those who partake in
this festival believe their deceased ancestors spend the night peeking
in on their descendants. On this night, the citizens wear masks to show
their loved ones how they fare—painted smiles or colorful masks show
they are doing well while painted frowns and grim masks indicate they
are not.

It is hoped that the ancestors will either see their good fortune and be
at peace or see their unhappiness and help change their lives for the
better. The elderly are given small gifts, favorite foods, and small
tokens in the hopes that they will look favorably upon their families
after they die. The recipients usually share the sweeter foods with
their children and grandchildren, making Ancestor Night a highly
anticipated event among the young. Homage is paid to St. Waldon the
Patron Saint of the Peaceful Death.

### The Night of Blood
The Night of Blood is celebrated on the first night of the “blood month”
of Novem. Animals are slaughtered so that the meat may be salted,
smoked, and cured for the long winter. High profile public executions
are traditionally carried out on the Night of Blood. Homage is paid to
St. Harald the Patron Saint of Plenty.

### The Feast of St. Lucilla the Kind
This one-night celebration in Novem is held to help the poor and
downtrodden. During the week leading up to the festival, citizens leave
gifts of food, clothing, and even coins in front of their doors. On the
night of the festival, citizens gather with family and friends while
Church missionaries feed the poor. St. Lucilla the Kind is the Patron
Saint of the Poor, Sick, and Needy.

### Yule
Yule is a week-long festival held in the month of Dechem during the
nights of the full moon, celebrating the end of the year and the
midpoint of winter. Goodwill is promoted in the hopes that it carries
over into the new year. Gifts are exchanged among loved ones and
neighbors. Gifts of food and drink are also left out at night for a
mythical character known as Sainted Klaus who is said to be the Patron
Saint of Winter Joy. In the wilds beyond the city walls, folk tend to
stay indoors at night as strange happenings are said to occur during
Yuletide.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Citizens of Dolmvay" tags="index @citizens-of-dolmvay" position="258,575" size="100,100">
# CITIZENS OF DOLMVAY

&gt; &quot;Halaw, good sirs. I see you are strangers to the White City. I know
&gt; the perfect place for you to take your rest.&quot;  
&gt; —Father Karles Trenton

The people of Dolmvay are a mixture of human cultures from all over
Amherth, however, it is not the chaotic melting pot of cities like the
Republic of Westport. Most of its citizens are native Valinians that are
divided into two main social classes—noble and commoner. Commoners are
further divided by wealth and profession into three subclasses—merchant,
craftsman/tradesman, and laborer. Two other subclasses exist that
transcend the normal social hierarchy—clergymen and adventurer.

The nobles own family lands and lay claim to hereditary titles. They
usually occupy large manor homes inside the city and maintain large
estates in other parts of the Duchy of Valnwall. The nobles once held an
enormous amount of power over the lives of the common folk, but this has
changed in recent times. Many nobles still (publicly or privately)
express disdain for those who are not of noble birth.

The commoners of Dolmvay make up the bulk of the city&#39;s population. They
practice a wide range of trades and professions (laborers, watchmen,
craftsmen, scholars, military, etc.) and their lifestyle is dependent on
individual wealth and status. The most influential commoners are either
members of the wealthy merchant families or high-ranking guild members
while the least influential are common apprentices and laborers.

It should be noted that clergymen and adventurers are afforded an
honorable status that usually transcends the normal social classes. This
status rises and falls based upon their deeds and popularity.

### Alignment
The citizens of Dolmvay are overwhelmingly Lawful in alignment. This
does not mean they are overwhelmingly &quot;good&quot;. This just means that most
citizens tend to abide by local laws and live stable, orderly lives.

Neutral-aligned citizens tend to be more common among the very rich and
the very poor. These citizens tend to be more self-serving and only obey
laws and customs that do not inconvenience their daily lives.

Chaotic-aligned citizens are uncommon, but are present throughout
Dolmvay. These tend to be criminals, dissidents, and other malcontents
who prey upon those weaker than themselves and twist the law to their
advantage.

### Daily Life
Dolmvay is the birthplace of the Church of Law and Order and its
citizens feel secure within the city&#39;s walls. It is a port city that
lies where the Dolm River empties into the Gulf of Valnwall and its
docks see traffic from all over Amherth. Dolmvay is no lawless city of
thieves. The Duke, the Church, and its citizens combine to make crime
difficult and the people expect to feel safe and protected.

The citizens of Dolmvay observe traditional gender roles, with men being
the primary wage earners and women being the primary homemakers.
Husbands and wives work together to raise and educate their children.
Children are expected to follow in their parents&#39; footsteps.

These roles are established norms dictated by society and the Church,
but they are not all inclusive—men and women sometimes assume
non-traditional roles, professions, and even relationships, to varying
degrees of acceptance.

The common Dolmvay man spends most of his time working and providing for
his family and home. He often specializes in a trade such as carpentry,
cobbling, baking, smithing, sewing, or butchering. If he does not own
his own shop, he may be forced to work in a guildworks. Common men
usually aspire to become high-ranking guild members or form their own
merchant families. Otherwise, they are unlikely to reach a position of
power or authority outside of becoming an adventurer or rising in the
Church of Law and Order.

Common women also spend much of their time working. Taking care of
children is a top priority, however, women also practice trades such as
sewing, weaving, midwifery, healing, and baking. The women of Dolmvay
often have more opportunities than their rural counterparts and are
allowed to own property and operate businesses.

Most commoners prefer large families. Children are another mouth to
feed, but they eventually grow up to become helping hands. Children are
taught to be respectful of authority, particularly the authority of the
Church of Law and Order. Church services are attended by the entire
family on Son&#39;s Day at the end of the work week. Homage is also paid
daily to the Saints of Law and Order. For example, a father whose child
is suffering from an illness may pray to St. Callor for healing while a
newlywed couple who desires children may pray to St. Leandra the Lady of
Blossoms.

The daily life of a Dolmvay noble is much different from that of a
commoner. Nobles are expected to be very active in the Church of Law and
Order, attending morning services each day, praying before every meal,
and attending services on Son&#39;s Day. Nobles also pay homage to the
various saints.

Noblemen spend much of their mornings tending to matters such as weapons
practice, figuring taxes, attending court, and hearing complaints from
their servants and subjects (if any). Afternoons are spent in leisure
activities such as hunting, hawking, poetry, or the arts, where the
noblemen can discuss politics amongst themselves and engage in private
intrigues.

Noblewomen spend much of their day in the gardens, weaving or listening
to music and poetry. A wealthy noblewoman might go on an afternoon
picnic or shopping spree with an entourage of guards and supporters.

The children of a noble house can expect all manner of comforts at home.
They are trained in courtly arts from a young age and are allowed to
pursue their own interests and hobbies. Arranged marriages are common,
and some children are even betrothed from birth. Noble children are
expected to be active in church activities (choirs, youth groups, junior
acolytes, etc.). In this way, they mix with the common folk and
hopefully learn a bit of humility.

An evening meal at a noble’s manor is usually an elaborate affair,
supplemented by entertainment such as music, dancing, jugglers,
acrobats, jesters, or animal shows.

### Dress
In the Duchy of Valnwall, clothing ranges from simple to elaborate,
depending upon one’s wealth and status. Shades of white, black, brown,
and green are most common, however, most folk like to add a splash of
brighter colors to their wardrobes. Nobles in particular occasionally
adopt ancient or foreign styles of dress to make themselves stand out,
creating a riot of color and fashion in busy places such as the Dolmvay
City Market.

Most common men wear loose linen or wool tunics over wool pants. Tunics
typically belt at the waist and fall to the mid thigh. Noblemen prefer
wool leggings instead of pants and wear tunics spun from silk and other
quality cloths. Vests and jackets are common among both classes and
cloaks are worn in cold weather. For parties and ceremonies, noblemen
wear robes or tunics that fall to the ground. Leather shoes are worn by
most common city dwellers—pointed for nobles and flat or slightly
rounded for commoners.

Common women usually wear long tunics that belt at the waist and fall to
the ground. Noblewomen prefer sleeved dresses made of quality cloth that
can be simple or elaborate, depending on the occasion. Tights are worn
under tunics as women wearing pants is severely frowned upon by the
Church of Law and Order. Most women wear several layers of clothing if
they can afford to.

Hats and head coverings are common among men and women, particularly in
the colder months. Common men wear leather or fur caps with stirrups on
the sides. Noblemen prefer more extravagant hats decorated with gold and
silver lace trimming and plumes.

Common women often pull their hair back into a ponytail or bun for
function and wear scarves to cover their heads. They are allowed to wear
braids only on holy days or during festivals. Noblewomen weave their
hair into elaborate braids and sometimes wear tall fancy hats decorated
with streamers.

Adventurers have no restrictions on hairstyles or style of dress.

### Arms and Armor
The full range of weapons and armor are available in Dolmvay, however,
its citizens do not normally go around dressed for battle. Common folk
may carry a dagger, quarterstaff, or walking stick (club). Nobles
usually carry a dagger and long sword, although the light rapier of
Guildeland (+1 to-hit, 1d8-1 Dmg) has become more en vogue. Adventurers
are expected to dress the part, and many choose to walk the streets in
polished arms and armor.

## Rumors and Gossip

The City of Dolmvay is a bustling port city full of thousands of people
from all over Amherth. In this day and age, news travels primarily by
word of mouth. As most commoners seldom leave their own neighborhood or
quarter, rumors and gossip are extremely important to the average
citizen, causing a high demand for tradesmen such as City Criers.

Those traveling throughout the city (particularly adventurers) are
frequently stopped and asked what news they might have heard. Whether
the news involves the city itself or happenings abroad makes no
difference. Unless the characters are in a hurry, it is generally
considered courteous to stop and chat on occasion.

Rumors and gossip can be utilized by the DM to help spread
useful information, however, in many cases, they are simply a way for
folk to pass the time. Rumors and gossip serve an important role in the
average citizen’s life—entertainment.

Without gossip, the nobleman’s treasurer might never learn of the fire
that happened at the harbor. The potter toiling at the wheel all day
might never hear of the scandalous affair between the Watchman and the
moneylender’s wife. The milkmaid at the nearby farm might never know of
the battle that took place between pirates and the Valinian Navy.

In some cases, friendly gossip is considered almost as good as coin.
People are more willing to divulge information or otherwise help out
someone who brings them interesting news. Some taverns offer free ale to
travelers (adventurers, sailors, caravan guards, etc.) because of the
business their gossip brings in. Gossip is also a good way for merchants
and shopkeepers to strike up a conversation with potential buyers.

Characters whose rumors often prove true can usually expect a bonus of
+1 or higher to local Reaction rolls, while those who spout outlandish
tales or false rumors can expect to receive penalties of -1 to -3. Once
the characters make a name for themselves as adventurers, it won’t be
long before they become the subject of various rumors and gossip.

Most people try to be as accurate as they can when relaying rumors that
involve adventurers (with a few minor embellishments). However, the
characters might occasionally hear their own deeds attributed to others,
or vice versa.

Characters should be aware that rumors are unreliable by nature. When
passed along, they tend to change to reflect what the speaker knows and
understands.

For example, a rumor might begin as a merchant’s account of a savage
Skjolding viking causing trouble at the 5th Street Market. A guildworks
carpenter who hears the story might change the location to somewhere in
the Guild District. A beggar who hears this version of the story might
believe that it wasn’t a Skjolding at all, but probably the sewer
monster he’s seen lurking around an abandoned building in the Brown
Street neighborhood.

Whenever possible, the DM should try to incorporate rumors
into actual conversations. This sort of dialogue not only adds flavor to
a campaign, but also helps portray the city as a place that is full of
real people.

For example, if the DM plans to send the characters after a
band of marauding ruks and wants to set up the encounter, try not to
just say something like, “The shopkeeper tells you that ruks have been
sighted to the west.”

Instead, have the knife sharpener stop his grinding wheel for a moment
and say, “My cousin, Thereon works for a logging company west of the
city. He said he looked up from the log he was splitting and there, not
two feet away, a ruk was staring at him from the bushes. Old Thereon
raised his axe and gave a shout, and that ruk ran away, quick as you
please, but I expect there are more about. You fellows got any knives or
swords that need sharpening? You never can tell when a sharp blade will
come in handy.”

# CITY LAYOUT

&gt; &quot;Like a beacon in the night, with a light to rival that of the sun,
&gt; the purity and holiness of the White City stands above all.&quot;
&gt; *—from the History of Dolmvay by Father Ethan Harlen*

The City of Dolmvay is split between two Wards that lie on the north and
south banks of the Dolm River. These Wards are divided into broad
regional Districts. Districts are divided into Quarters that are usually
based on regional, ethnic, or occupational commonalities. Quarters are
further divided into Neighborhoods which typically encompass one to
three city blocks. A few of the more notable Quarters and Neighborhoods
are described in the text, but the DM is free to design his
own to better suit the needs of his campaign.

### Architecture
The architecture of Dolmvay is a mixture of old and new construction
made from stone and/or wood, with some of the older structures dating
back to the time of Vay. The architects of Vay used ancient magics that
melted and reshaped stone to build the city&#39;s foundation and sewers.
After the fall of the Great City, local stonemasons reverted to simpler
stacked stone construction. Over the years, the use of cut stones,
bricks, and wood has become more common.

The grandest buildings in Dolmvay such as the Ducal Palace and the
Cathedral of St. Poul are massive structures with arched portals,
columned arcades, stained glass windows, vaulted ceilings, and
hemispherical domes. However, the vast majority of the buildings
throughout the city are between one- to five-stories tall, with thick
shutters, opaque glass windows, and wooden doors. Flat roofs or pitched
roofs with a narrow walk along the peak are most common. White is used
to paint exterior walls and doors, giving rise to Dolmvay&#39;s nickname as
the White City.

Dolmvay streets tend to be narrow and formed by rows of attached
buildings, especially in the South Ward. The streets are made of
cobblestone and lined with gutters and sewer grates. Aqueducts are
either massive freestanding structures or are mounted along stone
buildings and city walls. Many neighborhoods are built around a central
square that usually contains a unique statue, fountain, or well that is
used too identify that neighborhood. A few grassy parks and narrow
canals are also located throughout the city.

### Residences
The citizens of Dolmvay dwell in a wide range of homes which are largely
dependent on one&#39;s wealth and status.

The poorest citizens are forced to dwell in cramped apartments inside
large, multi-family dwellings that are known as tenements. These
tenements can rise as high as nine stories tall (although four or five
stories is more common) and are often poorly maintained.

Journeymen craftsmen and tradesmen usually dwell in apartments above
their shops, although some purchase modest neighborhood homes. Master
craftsmen, tradesmen, and merchants can usually afford larger homes in
the nearby neighborhood.

Wealthier merchants and guild masters prefer to dwell in large manor
homes. Nobles dwell in even more extravagant manor homes located inside
walled compounds that can stretch for several city blocks. These manor
homes are often passed down for generations, and some date back to the
time of the Great City of Vay.

### Street Lighting
The streets of Dolmvay can be dark and treacherous at night. The North
Ward and some of the wealthier neighborhoods of the South Ward
(particularly in the Valenon and the District of Scholars) possess
street lamps that are maintained by City Watch patrols after dark. Open
businesses usually place candles in their windows or hang candlelit
lanterns beside their front doors, adding to the illumination.

Anyone traveling about after nightfall is required to carry a candle,
torch, or some other type of lighting. Those who do not are assumed to
be up to no good and may be detained by the City Watch.

### Water and Sanitation
The City of Dolmvay is a bastion of civilization and learning.
Cleanliness is a key element of the city&#39;s shining image. Visitors to
Dolmvay immediately notice that the city is extremely clean—far cleaner
than any other large city of this age. This is due to a massively
efficient aqueduct, sewer, and runoff system, as well as laws designed
to prevent the accumulation of trash and debris in the street. A filthy
city is a wicked city in the eyes of the Church of Law and Order.

The Streetsweeper&#39;s Guild is responsible for cleaning the streets, the
Watermans&#39; Guild manages the aqueducts, and the Sewerman&#39;s Guild
maintains the sewers. These guilds each employ hundreds of common
laborers and, in lieu of public incarceration, nonviolent prisoners may
choose to assist the guilds by scrubbing walls, cleaning gutters, and
unblocking drainpipes and sewer tunnels.

The sewers of Dolmvay are magical in nature and are further detailed on
[[Sewers of Dolmvay]].

### Transportation
The common citizens of Dolmvay usually travel the city&#39;s cobblestone
streets on foot. Guildsmen who work with animals (farmers, hostlers,
livestock sellers, etc.) are allowed to lead horses, oxen, mules, etc.
through the city at a slow walk. Wealthy merchants and nobles either
ride on horseback, in the back of ornate wagons, or are carried by
servants on extravagant litters. Adventurers are allowed to ride horses,
but are expected not to charge through busy streets at a full gallop.

King&#39;s Bay and the Dolm River see a steady stream of traffic throughout
the day, that slows at night everywhere except in the Guild District.
Local boat owners are sometimes hired to ferry wealthy passengers back
and forth across the Dolm in order to avoid getting stuck in foot
traffic on the main bridges.

### Walls and Gates
The outer walls surrounding Dolmvay stand approximately fifty feet tall.
Inner walls range in height from twenty to thirty feet tall. Walls
around parks, churches, and private residences typically range from four
to twelve feet in height.

Eight named gates provide access into the city. These gates are manned
at all times. They are typically open throughout the day and closed at
night. The named gates include the Traveler&#39;s Gate, the Market Gate, the
Harvest Gate, the Wharf Gate, Baygate, Guild Gate, the Gates of St.
Poul, and Kingsgate.

### Dolm River
The Dolm River runs north-south through the City of Dolmvay before
spilling out into King&#39;s Bay. The Dolm sees heavy traffic and plays a
major role in travel and commerce. The river has been dredged to allow
access to larger vessels and its sides are braced by walls of cut stone
blocks. A few cobblestone paths and grassy parks (particularly in the
North Ward) line the shores, providing a scenic view of the opposite
banks of the river.

## City Watch
The City Watch is responsible for protecting the lives and property of
the citizens of Dolmvay. Watchposts are located throughout the city.
Watchmen patrol the city in teams of two, responding to calls for help,
assisting citizens, and checking businesses after dark. Watchmen swear
oaths of ethics and loyalty and are difficult to bribe, intimidate, or
corrupt.

Watchmen wear helmets, chain mail armor, and surcoats emblazoned with
the city&#39;s standard. They typically carry spears, long swords, and
daggers. Watchmen are also trained in the use of crossbows which can be
collected from the nearest Watchpost armory in times of need. The
penalties for assaulting a Watchman on duty are steep.

## Harbor Watch
The Harbor Watch is a branch of the City Watch responsible for
patrolling the river and harbor. The Harbor Watch is headquartered in
the Riverlord Watchpost on the Dolm River. Harbor Watchmen wear leather
armor and carry long swords, clubs, and daggers. The Harbor Watch
recruits only the toughest and most proactive City Watchmen.

**Harbor Watchman:** treat as 0-level human with Str 13, AC 12 (leather
armor), hp 4, spear (Dmg 1d6+1), short sword (Dmg 1d6+1), dagger (Dmg

### Lawguard
Lawguardians are clerics of Law and Order that have been assigned to
local City Watchposts. Their primary role is to assist the Watch with
major trouble, heal wounded Watchmen, and investigate supernatural
occurrences. Lawguardians wear chain mail armor and wield maces or
quarterstaffs in battle. Lawguardians often become heroes to the
neighborhoods they serve.

# OTHER FEATURES

&gt; &quot;There is no such beauty as that which is seen from the height of
&gt; Kingsbridge. I want every citizen of Dolmvay to experience that at
&gt; least once in their lifetime.&quot;  
&gt; —Duke Robert val Dolm

Other features of Dolmvay include bridges, islands, sites outside the
city walls, major roads, and the Dolmvay sewers.

## Bridges of Dolmvay
Three bridges cross the Dolm River. These are, in order from north to
south, Kingsbridge, the Dolm River Bridge, and the Bridge of Commons.

### Kingsbridge
Kingsbridge crosses the Dolm River to connect the Palatial District with
the District of Scholars. This ancient structure was built long ago
during the time of Vay and consists of a narrow arched bridge that soars
unsupported over the Dolm River to a height of seventy feet. A viewing
platform at the bridge&#39;s highest point provides a breathtaking view of
Dolmvay and the Gulf of Valnwall—on a clear day it is said that one can
even see the outline of the massive seawall known as the Great Valnwall.

Kingsbridge may only be used with permission of the royal family. In
recent years, Duke Robert val Dolm has considered opening the bridge to
the public, but his advisors have cautioned against this, citing safety
concerns.

### Dolm River Bridge
The Dolm River Bridge (a.k.a. Dolmsbridge) crosses the Dolm River to
connect the City Center District with the River District. It is a wide
stone bridge lined with shops and apartments. A drawbridge on the
eastern side of the bridge is opened twice daily (once in the morning
and once in the afternoon) to permit taller vessels to pass through.
Dolmsbridge is officially considered part of the City Center District,
and its shops and businesses tend to cater to the upper middle class. A
number of interior and exterior staircases descend from Dolmsbridge to
Gull Island.

### Bridge of Commons
The Bridge of Commons crosses the Dolm River to connect the City Center
District with the River District. It is a narrow stone bridge that is
used mainly by servants and laborers traveling to and from the District
of Nobles. A drawbridge on the eastern side of the bridge is opened
twice daily (once in the morning and once in the afternoon) to permit
taller vessels to pass through. The Bridge of Commons crosses over
Riverlord Isle.

## Islands of Dolmvay
Four islands are located within the city limits along the Dolm River.
These are Gull Island, Riverlord Isle, the Isle of Heroes, and Dungeon
Rock.

### Gull Island
This small island on the south side of Dolmsbridge is home to the
Bridgers Guild—a faction of carpenters, stonemasons, and smiths who
maintain the three bridges crossing the Dolm. A few shops and taverns
are located on Gull Island, but the patrons tend to be unfriendly
towards outsiders, especially those of high birth. Gull Island is
officially part of the City Center District.

Thousands of gulls roost among the rooftops of Gull Island. In most
regions of King&#39;s Bay, seagulls have been driven away by the more
aggressive dovecrows, but for some reason dovecrows do not like to
venture close to Gull Island. The DM is free to determine
why this may be.

### Riverlord Isle
This island is home to a few small taverns, shops, and a small keep once
known as Riverlord Castle. The Riverlord was a warlord who rose to power
after the fall of Vay, but was deposed by armies of the first Duke
Willhelm val Dolm. Riverlord Castle now houses the Riverlord Watchpost
of the City Watch. Riverlord Isle is officially part of the River
District.

### The Isle of Heroes
The Isle of Heroes is the headquarters of the Dolmvay Adventurer&#39;s
Guild. It consists of a walled fortress, meeting halls, workshops,
studies, stables, private dorms, and practice greens. Only active
members of the Adventurer&#39;s Guild are allowed to use these facilities.

The Isle of Heroes and the Adventurer&#39;s Guild are described in more
detail on [[Isle of Heroes]].

### Dungeon Rock
This walled fortress was built to house heretics, spies, political
hostages, and other vile prisoners before their trials. The island&#39;s
rocky shores serve as a breakwater to the bay&#39;s more violent waves. Only
five prisoners have ever managed to escape from Dungeon Rock. The
mangled bodies of four of these escapees were found dashed upon the
island&#39;s shores. The body of the fifth, an assassin known only as Vigon
the Nightshade, was never found, but is believed to have
been swept out to sea.

## Outside the Walls
A number of notable sites exist outside the city walls.

### Plague Town
This small collection of shacks and hillside caves began as a leper
colony, but has expanded to include all those suffering from terminal
diseases. The colony is centered around the Church of St. Callor whose
priests attempt to ease the suffering of the sick and dying.

According to church history, St. Callor was a holy man who died from a
strange fever and then rose from the dead to spread the glory of Law and
Order in the lands far to the north\*. Although the lepers are
considered active members of the church, it is felt they can contribute
nothing significant to the good of the church and are therefore not
entitled to church healing magic.

### Merchant Camps
Visiting merchants often stop outside of the city gates in order to
house livestock and avoid paying full taxes for their goods. These camps
are serviced by the few taverns, brothels, and street vendors available.
There is no regular City Watch presence and the merchants and other
residents of these camps must see to their own protection.

The camps have a reputation for lawlessness and vice that would not be
tolerated inside the city walls. Detachments of City Watchman assisted
by the Lawguard occasionally sweep the camps in order to apprehend
criminals, seize contraband, and seek out fugitives. The last such sweep
resulted in the arrest of several members of a Bear cult performing
ritual cannibalism and the Church of Law and Order is organizing a new
faction to patrol the camps and bring law to the lawless.

### Mound of Valen
This tall hill located just north of the City of Dolmvay is a sacred
site where Valen of Vay rallied his troops before they marched to war. A
twisting path passes by the Abbey of St. Meschil as it winds up and
around the hill. The Mound of Valen is rumored to be riddled with secret
caves, hidden tombs, and ancient passages from an earlier age, but the
Dukes of Dolm and the Church of Law and Order have forbidden adventurers
from exploring and defiling this holy site.

### The Son of Sons
This 50&#39; tall iconic stone statue of St. Valen of Vay, also known as the
Son of Sons, overlooks the city of Dolmvay from atop the Mound of Valen.
The statue depicts St. Valen kneeling before his fabled sword which has
been thrust into the ground before him, symbolically marking the
boundary between Law and Chaos. The statue is surrounded by a ring of
standing stones that were erected ages past by unknown hands.

### The Abbey of St. Meschil
The Abbey of St. Meschil is an asylum dedicated to helping those
afflicted with normal and magical illnesses of the mind. The story of
St. Meschil goes back to the time of the Great City of Vay. According to
legends, Meschil was born to a large family of fishermen in a small
coastal village. Her father Ervin was a devout follower of the Church of
Law and Order. Her mother Salome was a refugee from the ravaged lands
near the ruined city of Mor. Although Salome had converted to the church
when she married, she still paid homage to the Old Gods and folk rituals
of the Druun.

As a child, Meschil would sometimes enter a trancelike state in which
she chanted in an arcane language, drew strange designs in the dirt, and
began to hear &quot;voices&quot;. Meschil&#39;s mother taught her which herbs to
harvest and how to brew potions that helped keep these trances at bay,
but the &quot;voices&quot; in Meschil&#39;s head persisted.

Meschil realized that the designs she had been drawing while in her
trances were actually the steps to a dance that, when performed, helped
focus her thoughts and bring peace of mind. Meschil also realized that
when she danced, the voices went away and she began to see visions of
the future.

Meschil&#39;s father came upon her one day while she danced, and grew
enraged and fearful at the sight. He demanded that she immediately go on
a pilgrimage to purify her body and spirit. Always the good daughter,
Meschil dutifully obeyed. She joined a pilgrimage of St. Lucilla the
Kind, and went from city to city helping the poor and downtrodden. But,
whenever she felt the trance start to come over her, she began to dance.

Meschil could not hide her dancing from her superiors. Instead of being
upset, they believed Meschil had been given a great gift. In their
travels, they had encountered many people who suffered from similar
trances, visions, and strange behavior. These unfortunate people were
known as visionarres, and most had been locked away in the dungeons
beneath the Valenon where priests prayed for them daily and occasionally
managed to decipher their cryptic phrases and predictions. Meschil&#39;s
superiors believed that her strange dance might actually be able to help
these lost souls.

Meschil danced her dance in front of the gibbering visionarres and saw
immediate results. The visionarres stopped to watch her dance and then
slowly began to join in, performing the moves step by step with her,
until they too were calm and at peace. Meschil&#39;s dance, which came to be
known as the Dance of the Visionarres, proved to be the first step
towards helping those who had been suffering from illnesses of the mind.
What&#39;s more, the prophecies of the visionarres became more focused and
clear.

The church decided the visionarres needed a place where they could be
free to experience their visions and perhaps guide church leaders down
the right path. An abbey was constructed, and Meschil spent the rest of
her life there trying to unlock the secrets of the visionarres. During
her studies, she developed many remedies and helped treat numerous
mental illnesses. Although most visionarres were unable to return to
Dolmvay society, they were able to find peace and interact with others
again.

Meschil was named a saint after her death and the abbey was dedicated in
her name. The Abbey of St. Meschil is now filled with people who have
exhibited symptoms of mental illnesses, although very few are true
visionarres.

Clergymen of St. Meschil are experts at seeking out and deciphering
prophecies. They spend their days searching for true visionarres to
serve the church, although in recent years, church doctrine has tended
to shy away from prophecies. Visitors to the asylum can often see
clergymen and patients alike performing the eerily beautiful Dance of
the Visionarres.

## Major Roads
Four major roads lead into and out of the City of Dolmvay. These are the
Kingsgarden Road, the Traveler&#39;s Road, the Market Road, and the Harvest
Road. A number of villages and other communities lie along these roads,
with inns and taverns spaced in between.

### Kingsgarden Road
The Kingsgarden Road leads north to the royal estate of Kingsgarden. It
is used mainly by nobles, royals, and famous adventuring companies. The
Kingsgarden Road is one of the safest roads in the Duchy of Valnwall.

### Traveler&#39;s Road
The Traveler&#39;s Road, also known as the Dolm River Road, loops around the
city crop fields and eventually runs north along the banks of the Dolm
River. The Traveler&#39;s Road passes through the farming town of Hillside
Farms and on to where the river forks at the city of Edgerton. The
Traveler&#39;s Road is commonly used by adventuring companies heading out
into the wilds.

### Market Road
The Market Road leads east and curves south, passing through several
small estates, orchards, and farming villages before joining up with the
Harvest Road. The Market Road is used mainly by farmers and merchants
bringing goods for sale in the Dolmvay Market.

### Harvest Road
The Harvest Road leads south and east, passing through several small
estates, orchards, and fishing and farming villages as it meanders along
the coast of the Gulf of Valnwall. The Harvest Road is used mainly by
farmers, fishermen, and merchants bringing goods to the Guild District
(for processing) or the Wharf District (for shipping).

## Sewers of Dolmvay
The sewers beneath the city of Dolmvay are a combination of natural and
manmade passages that were built at the height of Vay&#39;s power. The
sewers are powered by ancient magic and its waters empty into a giant
whirlpool that lies deep beneath the Dolm River. This whirlpool produces
a steady current that draws trash and debris, and generally keeps the
sewers clean, however, minor blockages have occurred over the years and
many of the smaller sewer chambers have become filled with stagnant
water.

The sewer tunnels and chambers magically realign themselves to redirect
flow around major blockages, requiring sewer maps to frequently be
updated. This realignment sometimes exposes lost chambers, hidden caves,
and ancient dungeons. Only senior members of the Sewermen&#39;s Guild
understand the magical nature of Dolmvay&#39;s sewer system. What happens to
the trash after it enters the mystical whirlpool is a mystery even to
them.

The Sewers of Dolmvay are fully detailed on [[Sewers of Dolmvay]].

# OTHER NPCs AND FACTIONS OF NOTE

&gt; &quot;We came upon the *Lady Sarah* adrift at sea. Ripped sails, bloody
&gt; decks, yet not a body in sight. This was not an act of piracy—the
&gt; cargo hold was untouched. The Sea Witch and her ilk have returned, I
&gt; tell you.&quot;  
&gt; —Captain Garrey &quot;Kelpbeard&quot; Benertan

The following NPCs and factions may be encountered throughout the City
of Dolmvay.

## The King&#39;s Army

The Duchy of Valnwall maintains a large standing army called the King’s
Army, which is ostensibly loyal to the line of its founder, King Herek
of the Kingdom of Might. Valinian foot soldiers are typically outfitted
with helmets, leather armor, shields, spears, long swords, and daggers.
Officers wear chain mail. Archer companies are outfitted with leather
armor and heavy or light crossbows. Elite archer companies are equipped
with the devastating Valinian longbow (+1 to-hit and +1 to damage),
which is specially crafted from the wood of the great trees. Valinian
knights wear plate mail and wield heavy lances.

## The King&#39;s Navy

The Valinian navy prefers modern sailing vessels with an emphasis on
large, heavily armed frigates to patrol the Gulf of Valnwall and beyond.
Naval officers carry long swords and daggers. Common sailors carry
daggers, but can be armed with long swords, shields, and crossbows from
the ship&#39;s armory. Military ships are often manned by a company of
marines who wear studded leather armor and carry shields, long swords,
and daggers. The King&#39;s Navy is steeped in tradition and has a
reputation of pride and excellence.

## Knightly Orders

Knightly orders may only be formed by the clergy or the nobility.
Knights typically swear allegiance to a noble lord or church faction
(particularly the Sainted Orders). Knights are trained in all manner of
martial arts and social graces. They are expected to be active in the
church and follow the Code of Chivalry.

Any person of noble or common birth may be accepted into a knightly
order. A knight begins his career as a squire in the service of a
knight. Only through loyalty and skill in battle may he be &quot;knighted&quot;
and himself become a knight. Particularly loyal and skilled knights may
even be awarded lands and noble titles.

A number of knightly orders are found throughout Dolmvay including the
Duke&#39;s own Iron Wolves and the Knights of the Red Hilt. Each order
possesses its own identifying colors and symbols.

## Mercenary Companies

Mercenary companies are bands of professional soldiers who hire out to
the highest bidder. Unlike knightly orders and adventuring companies,
mercenary sellswords are not held to any special code, ideal, or
standard. Mercenary companies are only interested in results, and most
do whatever it takes to get the job done. Many of their members are
former thugs, pirates, and brigands, further adding to their unsavory
reputation.

A number of different mercenary companies pass through Dolmvay in search
of work, including the Homeless Men and the Silver Longbraids. Common
employers include guilds, noble houses, and merchant families. Each
mercenary company possesses its own identifying colors and symbols.

## Religious Factions

The Church of Law and Order plays a dominant role in the lives of every
citizen. Worshipers of the Druun, the Church of Chaos and Destruction,
and other religious factions may also be found in Dolmvay.

## The Church of Law and Order

The Church of Law and Order is the dominant religion in the City of
Dolmvay. It is based in the Valenon, a sovereign city-state whose
territory consists of a walled enclave within the city.

The Valenon and the Church of Law and Order are further described on [[The Valenon]].  

**Note:** If the *Chronicles of Amherth™* setting is being used, not all
of the clergy are spellcasting clerics.

## Druun (pr. DREW-un)

The Druun was a nature-worshiping religion once widely practiced
throughout the lands that are now known as the Duchy of Valnwall,
especially in the Great City of Mor.

Druun priests were philosophers, prophets, and spiritual leaders who
rose to power and guided the people in the dark times following the fall
of the Thirteen Cities. Druun priests wore brown robes and tended sacred
groves (usually oak), hidden pools, ancient stone henges, and other holy
sites. The symbols of the Druunic Order included sickles, mistletoe, and
oak.

The Druun were known to practice animal sacrifice to appease the forces
of nature. On certain holy days, it is said they also practiced human
sacrifice by drowning, hanging, and then ritual mutilation in a ritual
known as the &quot;Threefold Death&quot;. Another sacred human sacrificial ritual
known as the &quot;Wooden Man&quot; involved the burning of a live captive to
appease the spirits of nature. These barbaric practices are denounced by
the Church of Law and Order.

During the Age of Might, the powerful Druunic Order of Pagonnus
encouraged the ancient noble houses of Amalor to oppose the forces of
Duke Willhelm Dolm, and many bloody battles were fought at their behest.
Duke Willhelm eventually prevailed (with the help of the Church of Law
and Order), and the Druun priesthood was outlawed and forced into
hiding. Druun priests occasionally turn up as the head of some beast or
nature cult that opposes the church&#39;s rule, and the term &quot;pagon&quot; has
become synonymous with any religion not of the church.

The Druunic Order has left a lasting mark in the history of the land and
many people still pay homage to their folk rituals and beliefs.

## Church of Chaos and Destruction

The Church of Chaos and Destruction is the chief opposition to the
Church of Law and Order and has adopted many of its trappings, including
a similar hierarchy, rituals, and the veneration of saints. Their most
iconic figure is St. Jessical the Burner, a mythical sorceress who is
said to have lived during the time of the Great Cities. Chaos legends
say that Jessical and the heroic Valen of Vay were once lovers until she
spurned him. The Church of Law and Order denies these heresies of
course.

Chaos priests believe that weakness must be eliminated and that true
strength can only be achieved through chaos—lies, intrigue, betrayal,
dissent, and war all help to expose and eliminate the weak, leaving the
rest of society stronger by default. Concepts such as mercy and
compassion as well as laws designed to protect others only serve to
weaken society as a whole. Chaos priests believe magic is a form of
strength and work closely with magic-users to further their own ends.

## Other Religions

A scattering of other religions and cults are worshipped in Dolmvay such
as the Gods of Amherth, Il&#39;Re the One True God, a cat god named
Trobilla, a snake god named Sath, a bear spirit named Three Toe, a sea
god named Gurosalla, and a dragon god named Rostaarl the Devourer. The
demihumans living in and around Dolmvay also worship their own
pantheons. Most of these worshipers keep their religious practices
private in order to avoid persecution by the Church of Law and Order.

## Broklaw Gangs (pr. BROH-klaw)

A broklaw is a criminal organization whose members engage in illegal
activities to amass wealth and power. Broklaws are usually centered
around one or two neighborhoods or quarters, however, some of the more
powerful broklaw gangs exert influence throughout the entire city. They
are fiercely territorial and often develop deadly rivalries with other
broklaws. Broklaws have no respect for authority and often come into
conflict with the City Watch. However, very few broklaws admit
spellcasters into their ranks in order to avoid the attention of the
Lawguard.

Individual members of a broklaw may also be members of the Thieves&#39;
Guild, but this is not a requirement. Broklaws possess their own
hierarchy, cant, and identifying symbols. The Gange Consortium, the
Vicious Licious, and the Society of Ear, Beard, and Foot are examples of
broklaw gangs.

## Demihuman NPCs and Factions

The demihuman residents of Dolmvay are a motley collection of wanderers,
outcasts, and visitors from foreign lands. Most of these demihumans
dwell in the Demihuman Quarter, but some have opened businesses in other
parts of the city and become respectable members of society. A few
demihuman entourages from neighboring kingdoms are also present in
Dolmvay, but these rarely associate with the disreputable denizens of
the Reek.

**Note:** Unless otherwise noted, NPC elves, dwarves, and halflings use
the (non-spellcasting) listings given in the Montsters Manual.

## Vanhurr Elves

The Vanhurr elves are a militant tribe of elves who dwell in a sacred
forest to the west known as the Holtu Vanhurr. The Vanhurr have
dedicated their lives to combating the evil creatures and ancient magics
trying to escape the Wastelands of Aal. They have forged an alliance
with the Duchy of Valnwall and consider Duke Robert and his family to be
honored friends. Their relationship with the Church of Law and Order is
a great deal more strained, and the citizens of Dolmvay have learned to
their dismay that an angry elf is a dangerous elf.

## Wood Elves

The reclusive Wood Elf King of eastern Valnwall sealed his borders after
the Fall of Mor and has had little to do with the other races ever
since. A Wood Elf entourage in Dolmvay is a rare sight, and almost never
signifies anything good.

## Gundamark Dwarves

The dwarves of Gundamark dwell in great halls beneath the Callaheim
(Cloudbother) Mountains of northeastern Valnwall. The Dwarf Realm of
Gundamark maintains an ancient alliance with the Duchy of Valnwall. The
dwarves of Gundamark are engaged in an ongoing war with the rukha of the
Ruklands. The citizens of Dolmvay respect the dwarves&#39; craftsmanship and
share their hatred of ruks, making dwarves the most accepted of all the
demihuman races.

## Halflings

The majority of the halflings found throughout the duchy belong to gypsy
family clans known as Holk, who wander the realm in brightly colored
wagons, putting on small carnivals and fairs for local villages and
towns. Holk festivals involve music, storytelling, games of chance,
acrobatic displays, freak shows, and trained animal acts.

The Holk have a reputation as tricksters and petty thieves. They
sometimes come to Dolmvay to resupply, trade goods, recruit new members,
and discuss rumors and gossip. Like many other halflings, the Holk tend
to suffer abuses at the hands of &quot;Tall Folk&quot;. Unlike other halflings,
however, the Holk find ways to subtly retaliate against those who have
done them wrong.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Common Shops and Businesses" tags="encounter @common-shops-and-businesses" position="1728,513" size="100,100">
# COMMON SHOPS AND BUSINESSES

&gt; &quot;Hot Cherry Dolmcakes for three slaves! Come, celebrate the birth of
&gt; our beloved Duke!&quot;  
&gt; —Robard the Spider Street Baker

A variety of merchant shops may be found throughout the City of Dolmvay.
Most are one- to three-story buildings with a workshop or display room
on the first floor and living quarters for the shop owner and his family
on the upper floors. A basement or cellar is another common feature as
well as a small vegetable garden behind the shop.

All of the normal weapons, armor, and equipment listed in the
**Equipment** section of the Player&#39;s Handbook and the Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide may be purchased in Dolmvay at the normal
rates. The DM may wish to increase these prices by 5%-20% or
more in the North Ward in order to reflect the (real or imagined) higher
quality of the item. Listed below are basic flavor descriptions of the
most common types of city shops and businesses.

### Alchemist

An alchemist brews potions and medicines. A typical alchemist&#39;s shop
doubles as a laboratory. Alchemist shops are avoided by most locals
except the magic-users who work with them to brew magical potions and
the Thieves&#39; Guild which sometimes contracts alchemists to brew poisons.
Common sights include dusty shelves lined with exotic ingredients (eye
of newt, fairy wings, etc.), ancient tomes, recipe books, and glass
vessels full of bubbling liquids.

### Animal Trainer

The makeup of an animal trainer&#39;s shop varies with the animal being
trained. An animal trainer typically specializes in only one type of
animal (horse, dog, dovecrow, falcon, etc.) and may teach that animal to
respond to commands or perform various tricks. Common sights include
penned animals, bins of food, and gear for the animal being trained
lining the walls (tack and harness, saddles, hoods, leashes, etc.).

### Armorer

An armorer is a type of blacksmith who specializes in forging weapons
and metal armor. A typical armorer&#39;s shop contains a shop in the front
and a forge in the rear, although the two are often combined into one
large room. An armorer&#39;s shop is always hot and the doors and windows
are usually left open. Common sights include the armorer and several
apprentices working the forge, iron molds, piles of raw ingots, and
several finished weapons or suits of armor hanging from the walls.

### Artist

Artists include sculptors, carvers, painters, glassblowers, potters, and
any other creative types who work with their hands. Other types of
artists such as musicians and poets seldom have shops and usually rely
on patronage. A typical artist&#39;s shop doubles as a gallery and workshop.
Common sights include the artist&#39;s work area, with various tools and
works of unfinished and finished art on display.

### Bakery

A typical bakery consists of a shop in the front and ovens in the rear.
Bread is a staple in most diets so the bakery stays busy throughout the
day. Some bakeries only bake bread while others deal in pastries and
cakes for the wealthy. Common sights include white-aproned bakers and
their apprentices bustling back and forth, servants picking up
deliveries, large ovens, and racks of fresh bread, rolls, and other
pastries.

### Blacksmith

A blacksmith works with metal, forging and repairing farming equipment
and common household items. A few blacksmiths can also mend and repair
armor and weapons. A typical smithy contains a shop in the front and a
forge in the rear, although the two are often combined into one large
room. A smithy is always hot and the doors and windows are usually left
open. Common sights include a blacksmith and several apprentices working
the forge, iron molds, piles of raw ingots, and finished items (buckets
of nails, horseshoes, gardening tools, etc.) displayed around the front
room.

### Boat Builder

A boat builder designs, builds, and repairs boats and ships. A boat
builder may specialize in building a particular type of boat (such as a
sailing vessel) or he may be skilled at building all types of boats. In
Dolmvay, most small boat building operations are located in the Wharf
District while larger vessels are produced at guildworks shipyards in
the Guild District.

### Bookbinder

A bookbinder assembles a book from loose sheets of parchment and
attaches a cover. Books have become more and more popular in Dolmvay.
The Church of Law and Order has documented its tenets as well as the
history and exploits of the legendary hero Valen of Vay in a text full
of anecdotes and parallels to everyday life known as The Guiding Light. Ornate versions of this book are always in high demand
among the wealthy. Other common texts include historical texts, books of
poetry, heraldry and genealogy books, and private memoirs. Common sights
include stacks of parchment, book-lined shelves, and jars of sticky
glue.

### Bowyer

A bowyer handcrafts bows and fletches arrows. A few bowyers are also
skilled in crafting crossbows. A bowyer&#39;s shop is a simple room that
doubles as a workshop. A target range is often located out back. Common
sights include unfinished bows and arrows, a workbench surrounded by
carving knives and wood shavings, and one or two long and short bows of
fine quality on display.

### Brewer

A brewer brews spirits such as whiskey, mead, and beer. Most taverns and
inns buy beer in bulk from guildworks breweries in the Guild District. A
local brewer, on the other hand, strives for quality over quantity,
often using personal recipes that have been handed down for generations.
A brewer&#39;s shop consists of a sampling room upstairs, vats and stills in
the rear, with a cellar below (or out back) to keep the spirits cool.
Common sights include a small tavern-style bar with barrels of various
spirits for tasting.

### Brothel

A brothel is an establishment where men and women pay to engage in
pleasures of the flesh. A typical brothel consists of a sitting room
where customers are plied with drink and introduced to &quot;ladies of the
evening&quot;, numerous private bedrooms, and a vault or office where money
is stored. The quality of a brothel varies widely, and disease is
rampant in some of the seedier dives. Common sights include scantily
clad women (or men), plush furniture, exotic costumes, and burly
guardsmen. The Church of Law and Order denounces those who work at or
frequent brothels, but has been unable to make the practice illegal.

### Butcher

A butcher slaughters animals, dresses the carcass, and then sells the
meat to local customers. Most butchers buy slabs of fresh meat from the
slaughterhouses of the Guild District and then process these slabs into
choice cuts. A butcher&#39;s shop consists of a display room in front and a
storage/processing room in the rear. Meats that have sat for longer than
a day or so may be sold off at a lower price. Common sights include cuts
of meat, chopping blocks, scales, and cleaver-wielding butchers wearing
bloodstained aprons.

### Candlemaker

A candlemaker makes candles out of tallow (animal fat). Candles made of
beeswax costs three times as much as tallow candles and are usually
reserved for the wealthy. Candles and candlelit lanterns are the primary
source of lighting in Dolmvay. Common sights include boxes of various
colored/scented candles on display, ornate candlesticks for sale, and
apprentices molding new candles. A few candlemakers are also skilled
lampmakers, but the use of oil lamps is considered a foreign affectation
that is shunned by most citizens.

### Carpenter

A carpenter builds wooden furniture and wood frame structures such as
homes, stables, and even gallows. A carpenter&#39;s shop usually doubles as
a workshop. Common sights include small models of past constructions,
unfinished furniture, scrolls with floorplans and designs, tools hanging
from the walls, and at least one drafting table.

### Cheesemaker

A cheesemaker makes cheese from the milk of creatures such as goats,
sheep, and cows. This involves a process of heating and cooling the milk
and other ingredients and then separating the curds (cheese) from the
whey. A cheesemaker&#39;s shop consists of a front room with kitchens in the
rear. Cheesemaking produces a distinct odor that can be unpleasant, and
most cheesemaking shops are located in the Guild District. Common sights
include wheels of cheese on display, buckets of milk, and apprentices
stirring vats of heated curds.

### Church

Churches of Law and Order are present in almost every neighborhood in
Dolmvay. A typical church is a hilt-shaped structure that consists of an
altar, baptismal font, side chapels, and worship hall. A church can be a
single building or a small fenced-in compound with several buildings. A
few of the larger churches contain rectories and dorms for priests and
acolytes. Common sights include stained glass windows, acolytes going
about daily chores, and the faithful stopping by to worship.

### Clerk/Copyist

A clerk/copyist creates copies of scrolls, books, leaflets, and other
written works. A clerk/copyist&#39;s shop doubles as a workshop. Common
sights include stacks of paper, cabinets full of quills and ink, and
books being copied by apprentices with ink-stained fingers.

### Cloth Merchant

Cloth merchants deal in bolts of mundane or exotic cloth. A cloth
merchant&#39;s shop consists of a front display room with a storeroom in the
rear. Common sights include bolts of colored cloth on display, a
measuring table, and samples of finished cloth items such as clothing,
drapes, and tablecloths.

### Cobbler

A cobbler makes and repairs shoes. The typical cobbler&#39;s shop doubles as
a workroom. Common sights include a cobbling station, tools, measuring
tape, and shoes and boots arranged on display.

### Exotic Dealer

This is a catchall for a merchant who deals in foreign imports such as
spices, silks, weapons, furniture, and other items not commonly found in
the Duchy of Valnwall. A dealer in exotic goods may specialize in items
from different cultures (human or nonhuman) or artifacts, tomes, and
relics from ancient times. Common sights include expensive furnishings,
display racks full of exotic goods, and barbarian bodyguards.

### Farmer/Grocer

A farmer&#39;s or grocer&#39;s shop sells fruit, vegetables, milk, and other
farm products. Common sights include jugs of milk, wedges of cheese,
baskets of eggs, jars of preserves, and bins of fresh (and not-so fresh)
fruits and vegetables.

### Fishmonger

The fishmonger sells fresh fish and other aquatic delicacies brought in
daily from the Gulf of Valnwall or the Dolm River. A fishmonger&#39;s shop
consists of a front display room and a backroom where seafood is
processed. The fishmonger may be an independent seller who purchases his
wares wholesale from local fishermen or (more likely) is a wife or child
of one of these local fisherman. Common sights include bins overflowing
with fresh fish, crabs, oysters, and lobsters.

### Florist

A florist sells flowers and flower arrangements. A florist&#39;s shop
doubles as a workshop. Common sights include bouquets of fresh flowers,
complex flower arrangements, and the florist and her apprentices weaving
garlands, trimming flowers, and stuffing vases.

### Fortuneteller

A fortuneteller is a person who claims to be able to predict the future
through some arcane method of divination. Most fortunetellers are
charlatans, but a few possess actual powers.
Common sights include astrological charts, palm reading tapestries,
sacks full of bones for throwing, rune sticks, Tarot cards, and a
covered crystal ball. The business of fortunetelling has been denounced
by the Church of Law and Order and fortunetellers are shunned by most
law-abiding citizens.

### Glassmaker

A glassmaker makes glass from sand, limestone, and wood ash. This glass
is then blown into small vessels such as vases and decanters or into
cylinders which can be flattened into windows. Glass can be opaque,
clear, or colored. Although most glassmakers concentrate on functional
items, a few specialize in creating works of art. A glassmaker&#39;s shop
consists of a front display room and furnaces in the rear. Common sights
include finished pieces of blown and flat glass, stained glass displays,
and the glassmaker blowing glass while his apprentices tend the forge.

### Healer/Herbalist

A healer/herbalist uses a combination of home remedies, rituals, and
plants to heal the sick and injured. Healing is the domain of the church
and almost all healers have ties to the Church of Law and Order.
However, many of their rituals and remedies are holdovers from folk
religions such as that of the Druun.

### Hostler

A hostler buys, sells, and cares for horses. A typical hostler&#39;s shop
doubles as a stable, with an office in the front and stalls in the rear.
A small pen or corral is usually attached to the shop. Common sights
include hay-lined stables, apprentices feeding horses and mucking
stalls, and the hostler haggling over the price of a horse.

### Inn

Inns are establishments of varying quality where travelers can seek
lodging, stabling, and sometimes food and drink. A typical inn consists
of a tavern on the first floor, lodging on the second, with a cellar
below and stables out back. A few inns also serve as brothels. Common
sights include foreign travelers enjoying a meal, musicians performing
for crowds, and bands of adventurers looking for work. See [[Taverns and Inns]].

### Instrument Maker

An instrument maker crafts one or more types of musical instruments such
as chimes, pipes, horns, lutes, or drums. This is a highly specialized

AC, and -1 to all ability checks for one day. The smoke from this herb
burns dark black and prolonged use permanently stains the fingers and
teeth.

# RANDOM TABLE: CITY ENCOUNTERS

&gt; &quot;The streets of Dolmvay hold as much adventure, and danger, as the
&gt; trackless wilds beyond the city walls.&quot;  
&gt; —Adventurer&#39;s Guild Headmaster Mikael of Patton

Dolmvay is home to a variety of citizens that characters can and do
interact with on a daily basis. Not all of these encounters need be
memorable. There is no need to stat up every barkeep, haggle the price
of every horseshoe, or provide detailed motivations for every lampmaker
the characters pass on the street. Random encounters should only come
into play when the DM is ready to break from &quot;down time&quot; or
when the characters do something that warrants further attention (such
as stopping to talk with random strangers).

## STOCK ENCOUNTERS
The following stock encounters can be placed anywhere in the city. These
encounters are loosely designed, so the DM may have to spend
an extra minute or so to decide how the encounter begins.

1.  Adventurer  
2.  Beggar  
3.  Broklaw Thug  
4.  City Watchman  
5.  Clergyman  
6.  Craftsman/Artisan  
7.  Craftsman/Artisan  
8.  Harlot  
9.  Inhuman  
10. Knight  
11. Merchant  
12. Merchant  
13. Nobleman  
14. Performer  
15. Sailor  
16. Scholar  
17. Soldier  
18. Thief  
19. Tradesman  
20. Tradesman  

#### Adventurer
This encounter may be with a single adventurer (01-50%), two adventurers
(51-75%), or an adventuring party (76-100%). The DM is free
to insert members of a named adventuring company or create new ones.
Adventurers usually enjoy stopping to talk with their colleagues. They
may be on their way to a job, returning from an adventure, or simply out
for a night on the town. Adventurers are usually a good source of
information about possible employment, power struggles, and other
happenings in the city.

#### Beggar
This encounter may be with a single beggar (75%) or a group of 2d4
beggars (25%). Beggars beg for coins, food, or items that can be readily
sold, especially extra weapons and armor. There is a 25% chance the
beggar(s) attempt to pick the characters&#39; pockets (45% chance of
success) if the characters do not give him coin. Most businessmen
attempt to discourage beggars from hanging around their shops. Beggars
are people-watchers who tend to be well informed about local happenings.

#### Broklaw Thug
This encounter is with 2d4 broklaw thugs hanging around a seedy tavern,
abandoned building, or dark alley. These are 0-level humans with AC 9,
hp 3, armed with clubs (Dmg 1d4) and daggers (Dmg 1d4). If eight thugs
are encountered, one will be a 1st level Fighter with hp 6 and Str 13
(+1 Dmg). Broklaw thugs tend to avoid confrontations with groups of
armed adventurers, however, they may stop to pick a fight with
characters who appear weak or are traveling alone. In some cases,
broklaw gangs may attempt to hire adventurers to help them eliminate
rivals.

#### City Watchman
This encounter involves 2d4 City Watchmen on routine patrol through the
city streets. The Watchmen tend to be friendly towards adventurers,
however, there is a 25% chance they are responding to a crime and cannot
stop to chat. At the DM&#39;s discretion, the Watchmen may ask
the adventurers for help with crowd control, investigation, and/or an
immediate threat.

#### Clergyman
This encounter involves 1d4 clergymen. The clergymen may be sweeping the
front of a chapel, sermonizing in the square, or socializing with
members of the calum. Clergymen are in touch with the communities they
serve (calums) and tend to be extremely well informed about local
happenings. There is a 5% chance the clergymen is one of the Blessed (a
spellcasting cleric).

#### Craftsman/Artisan
This encounter involves 1d3 craftsmen (carpenters, leatherworkers,
butchers, etc.) or artisans (painters, sculptors, etc.). Each craftsman
may be an apprentice (01-50%), journeyman (51-80%), or a master
(81-100%). The craftsmen may be out on business, trying to entice
customers into a shop, or simply on their way to the local tavern for a
drink and some gossip.

#### Harlot
This encounter involves 1d4 &quot;ladies of the evening&quot;. These women may be
diseased tramps (01-10%), common streetwalkers (11-50%), brothel wenches
(51-74%), wealthy courtesans (75-90%), or otherwise respectable women
looking for a pleasant diversion (91-100%). Harlots typically target
adventurers and attempt to create long-lasting relationships in the
hopes of benefiting from the adventurer&#39;s fame and future success. There
is a 10% chance the harlot is involved with a scheme to rob or kidnap
adventurers, at the DM&#39;s discretion.

#### Inhuman
This involves an encounter with 1d4 creatures who are not human,
including demihumans, humanoids, dopplegangers, were-creatures, undead,
etc. The DM is free to decide why the inhumans are wandering
around the city and determine their reaction to the party.

#### Knight
This involves an encounter with 1d3 members of a knightly order. The
typical knight is a 3rd level Fighter with hp 19, Str 15 and Dex 13,
wearing chain mail (AC 4), and carrying a long sword (Dmg 1d8+1). There
is a 75% chance the knight is accompanied by 1d4 squires which are
treated as 1st level Fighters with hp 6, Str 13, and carrying long
swords (Dmg 1d8+1). A friendly rivalry exists between knights and
adventurers, and there is a small chance the knight(s) may challenge a
Fighter character to a harmless duel. If befriended, knights could
become an excellent source of information regarding courtly intrigue.

#### Merchant
This involves an encounter with 1d3 merchants. These may be street
vendors, shop owners, or even members of a wealthy merchant family.
Merchants tend to view adventurers as walking, talking, gold mines.
Merchants go to great lengths to befriend adventurers in order to
establish long term relationships. If snubbed, the merchant(s) may begin
spreading unwholesome rumors about the characters.

#### Noble
This involves an encounter with 1d3 nobles. If the nobles are female,
they are almost always accompanied by 1d3 handmaidens as well as 1d3
guards (treat as 1st level Fighters with hp 6, chain mail (AC 5), and
long swords (Dmg 1d8). Most nobles view adventurers as they would any
other entertainers. They may stop to chat with a famous adventuring
company or ones that appear particularly successful (i.e. are wearing
fine clothes, weapons, and armor). An adventurer whose deeds have become
famous may be invited to an elaborate feast at the noble&#39;s manor home.

#### Performer
This involves an encounter with 1d4 performers. These may be street
performers (jugglers, acrobats, fire-eaters, etc.), traveling minstrels,
court fools, or part of a famous acting troupe. Most performers rely on
donations and patronage to survive. They may attempt to entertain or
befriend adventurers in order to increase their own popularity. It is
well known that the most famous adventuring companies were always
accompanied by a minstrel or poet who could immortalize their deeds.

#### Sailor
This involves an encounter with 1d6 sailors. These may be members of the
King&#39;s Navy, employed by a merchant family or noble house, or part of a
private crew. The sailors may be on their way to or from the docks,
purchasing supplies, or simply enjoying the sights (and taverns) in the
district. There is a 10% chance the sailors are scouting recruits for a
press gang. There is a 10% chance the sailors are part of a pirate crew
looking to target their next shipment. If this encounter occurs at
night, there is a 30% chance the sailors are just drunk and looking for
a fight.

#### Scholar
This involves an encounter with 1d3 scholars. These may be philosophers,
almen, scribes, etc. Scholars tend to be interested in the life of an
adventurer. Like performers, they often rely on patronage to survive and
are therefore likely to try to befriend successful adventurers. Scholars
tend to be well educated and stay informed of city politics. They often
have the ear of the public, so it is a good idea to treat them with
respect and dignity whenever possible.

#### Soldier
This involves an encounter with 1d4 soldiers. These may be members of
the King&#39;s Army, part of a mercenary company, or some foreign
dignitary&#39;s men who are in Dolmvay on business. Soldiers tend to be
friendly towards adventurers and are usually more than willing to stop
and exchange gossip or ask questions about fighting techniques and
preferred weapons. If befriended, soldiers can become a great source of
information on military politics and threats from abroad. If this
encounter occurs at night, there is a 30% chance the soldiers are just
drunk and looking for a fight.

#### Thief
This involves an encounter with 1d3 thieves. The thieves may be pick
pockets, strong-arm robbers, or stealthy burglars. There is a 25% chance
the thieves randomly target the characters. A pick pocket may single out
a party member, robbers may wait until the characters pass down a side
street before making their move, while burglars may follow the
characters back to their quarters and attempt to steal from them later.
There is a 10% chance the thieves attempt to recruit a PC thief for a
job.

#### Tradesman
This encounter involves 1d3 tradesmen (barkeeps, guides, farmers, etc.).
Each tradesman may be an apprentice (01-50%), journeyman (51-80%), or a
master (81-100%). The tradesmen may be out on business, soliciting
customers, or simply on their way to the local tavern for a drink and
some gossip.

## DETAILED ENCOUNTERS
The following detailed encounters are divided by district. They can be
used to spice up a session, foreshadow future events, or introduce new
plot hooks and adventures.

2.  Holy Vision  
3.  Honest Work  
4.  Ladies of the Evening

#### Body Disposal
A pair of thugs named Eric Penny and Karl Flade were hired to murder a
tailor named Pinprick Dave. The characters pass by a remote alley just
as the two men drop Dave&#39;s body down a storm drain.

If the characters confront Penny and Flade, the thugs either attack (if
the party appears weak) or attempt to flee (if the party appears
strong). If the characters do nothing, they learn that Pinprick Dave was
murdered for trying to cheat the Gange Consortium.

**Eric Penny and Karl Flade:** treat as 0-level humans with Dex 13, AC 8
(Dex), hp 3, clubs (Dmg 1d4), daggers (Dmg 1d4), and 1d4 cp each.

#### Holy Vision
A fisherman named Wayne Torman sees what he believes to be a vision of
St. Valen in a stain on the docks. Torman begs the PCs for help keeping
the crowd away while he goes to find a member of the clergy.

If the PCs agree, a crowd of onlookers gather to gaze in wonder at the
vision and a few street urchins make their way through the crowd,
picking pockets as they go. The victims believe the PCs are in league
with the thieves and a Reaction roll may be required to quiet the angry
crowd.

Torman arrives 1d4 turns later with a monk named Brother Erlon who
proclaims this section of the docks to be a holy site that is off limits
to foot traffic. A rainstorm several days later washes away the stain
and things return to normal, but all who witnessed the vision believe it
to have been a good omen.

**Onlookers:** treat as 0-level humans with AC 9, hp 2, and 1d4 cp.

#### Honest Work
A grizzled sea captain named Morgen Darby and two of his crewmen are
attempting to hire sailors and fighting men for their next voyage.
Captain Darby claims to possess a map depicting the location of treasure
hidden in ruins on an island near the Endos Horn. The map may be a fake,
the ruins may be filled with monsters, or Captain Darby may be a pirate
in disguise.

dagger (Dmg 1d4), trinkets and charms (worth 1d4 cp), and 1d4 cp.

#### Ladies of the Evening
A group of scantily clad harlots call to the PCs from a brothel balcony.
The harlots promise pleasures beyond imagining at a special rate for
adventurers. Adventurers who enter the brothel are treated to all manner
of drinking, gambling, and pleasures of the flesh. As an added twist,
the harlots may be in league with broklaw robbers or even a press gang
who wait nearby until the harlots signal that the PCs are indisposed.

#### Merfolk
A fisherman named Georage Chandlerson attempts to flag the characters
down. Georage claims to have captured a merman in his fishing nets. The
merman is hidden beneath a burlap sack and Georage offers to show the
merman to anyone who pays 1 cp.

The &quot;merman&quot; may simply be a deformed boy with webbed hands and feet, or
the poor creature may truly be a dying merman. If asked, Georage offers
to sell the merman for 100 gp. If freed, the grateful merman may rescue
the characters if they ever get into trouble on the open sea, at the
DM&#39;s discretion.

#### Mind Your Business
The characters see a well-dressed man named Doren don Evansley being
escorted through an alley by five rough-looking thugs. Don Doren is a
wealthy spice merchant who refused to be extorted by a broklaw gang
named the Foreign Warders. The Warders killed Doren&#39;s bodyguards and are
taking him to their hideout where their leader plans to make an example
of him.

When Doren sees the PCs, he tosses his gold signet ring at their feet
and says, &quot;1,000 pieces of gold to the man who frees me from this
vermin!&quot; The broklaw thugs stop and draw short swords as their leader
tells the characters to move on.

If the characters do nothing, Doren is taken away to be tortured and
killed. If the characters intervene, the thugs attack. If Doren is
rescued, he pays the full 1,000 gp reward and attempts to hire the
characters to eliminate the Foreign Warders.

**Thug (5):** treat as 0-level humans with AC 12 (leather armor), hp 3,
short sword (Dmg 1d6), dagger (Dmg 1d4), 1d4 cp. The leader has a small
purse with 25 gp that was stolen from Don Doren.

gold Evansley signet ring (worth 250 gp).

#### Murderous Rage
A fishmonger named Garald East has been convicted of unarmed assault
after selling gronted fish to his customers. East was sentenced to
public incarceration in the stocks outside the Deepwind Watchpost. An
angry crowd has gathered to pelt him with dung, eggs, and rotten
vegetables.

During the commotion, the characters see a stevedore named Stefan of the
Greendock draw his dagger and approach the helpless East with murder in
his eyes. Stefan&#39;s daughter has been bedridden since eating one of
East&#39;s gronted fish.

If the characters stop Stefan (either verbally or physically), Stefan
thanks them later. He is a pious man whose wife and three children would
miss him dearly. If the characters do nothing, Stefan stabs East to
death before being arrested by the City Watch.

**Stefan of the Greendock:** treat as 0-level human with Str 13, AC 9,
hp 4, dagger (Dmg 1d4), and 1d4 cp.

#### Pennies From Heaven
A thief named Quick Jonal has just botched a burglary of a moneylender&#39;s
shop and is attempting to outrun six of the moneylender&#39;s guards. Quick
Jonal begins throwing handfuls of silver pieces into the air as he runs
past the PCs, causing the crowd to go wild and dive for the coins. Two
of the moneylender&#39;s guards stop to recover the silver pieces while the
other four guards try to push their way through the excited crowd.

The guards confront any PC who picks up the coins and demand they be
returned. If the PCs refuse, the guards attack. The other four guards
arrive in 1d4 rounds to join the fight. The City Watch arrives in 2d4
rounds and attempts to arrest anyone still fighting. Quick Jonal may
reward the PCs later for helping him escape, at the DM&#39;s
discretion.

#### Press Gang!
A rival merchant family has recently been disrupting the Willhaven
Family shipping operations by stealing their cargo and sinking their
ships. Typical guardsmen have proven ineffective, so the Willhavens have
authorized the hiring of adventurers.

A greedy Willhaven sea captain has instead decided to pocket the coin
and press a band of adventurers into service in order to protect his
next shipment.

The press gang is led by a gruff boatswain named Harold Bergen. Bergen
and his gang may attack the party outright, doing subdual damage with
their clubs (the characters are knocked unconscious upon being reduced
to 0 hit points or less).

Bergen also has an arrangement with a local tavernkeeper to drug and
kidnap patrons, so he may choose this method to kidnap the party. The
characters must make a saving throw vs. poison or fall unconscious for
2d4 hours.

Characters taken by the press gang wake up several hours later aboard
the *Blue Maid* on their way to the Republic of Westport.

**Harold Bergen:** treat as 0-level human with Str 15, AC 9, hp 4, club

selling polished seashells from a dirty blanket. Prices range from 1 cp
(for 3 small shells) to 5 cp (for one medium-sized shell).

Moskins also has one large conch shell on sale for 1 gp. The shell
radiates magic to a *detect magic* spell. If blown, the shell summons a
swarm of hundreds of crabs that the owner of the shell may direct to
attack. The shell has 5 charges remaining.

**Crab Swarm:** AL N; MV 30&#39; (10&#39;); AC 13 (natural); HD 3; \#AT 1; Dmg 2
hit points (claws); SA engulf characters as per insect swarm, double
damage vs. unarmored characters; SV 0-level human; ML 11; XP 10.

#### Street Brawl
A pair of drunken merchant crews from the Widowbrook Family and the
Alban Family begin arguing over which crew commands the fastest ship.
The argument quickly escalates to a brawl.

One of the crews mistakes the party for members of the rival house and
attacks. The crewmen fight without weapons. If the characters use
weapons or magic, the rival crew flees. The City Watch arrives in 2d4
rounds and attempt to arrest everyone involved.

**Widowbrook Crew (10):** treat as 0-level humans with AC 9, hp 3,
dagger (Dmg 1d4), and 1d4 cp.

**Alban Crew (8):** treat as 0-level humans with AC 9, hp 3, dagger (Dmg
1d4), and 1d4 cp.

#### Striped Fury
The characters are passing by the docks where a team of stevedores is
having difficulty unloading a crate destined for the Menagerie of the
Fantastic and Bizarre. The ropes holding the crate snap and the crate
breaks open as it hits the docks, loosing a very angry tiger.

The tiger lashes out at anyone nearby. The crowd panics and several
people are trampled in the confusion. A pair of City Watchmen draw their
weapons and place themselves between the tiger and the crowd. The tiger
leaps onto a Watchman and knocks him to the ground.

If the PCs do nothing, the tiger mauls both Watchmen before fleeing down
an alley. The characters may be hired later to track the tiger down.

**Tiger:** AL N; MV 150&#39; (50&#39;); AC 14 (natural); HD 6; hp 31; \#AT 3; Dmg

#### Alligront
A gronted alligator has washed up through a storm drain after a recent
rain. The characters see the monster crawl into the open door of a
guildworks cloth factory and hear screams from inside. If they do
nothing, the monster kills a seamstress and drags her back down the
drain.

**Gronted Alligator:** AL N; MV 60&#39; (20&#39;)/Swim 90&#39; (30&#39;); AC 5
(natural); HD 2+1; hp 13; \#AT 1; Dmg 1d6+1 (bite); SA surprise on a 1-3

#### Frosty Mug
A chubby man named Cullen Broler is standing in front of a guildworks
brewery offering free mugs from a barrel of ale. Broler says the ale is
a new concoction made from a secret recipe called Broler&#39;s Brew.

The ale has a pleasant taste, but any character who drinks it must make
a saving throw vs. poison 1d4 turns later or be struck with explosive
diarrhea. No one at the brewery recognizes Broler&#39;s description or has
any knowledge of Broler&#39;s Brew.

#### Human Toll
The characters encounter an elf and two dwarves on a narrow side street
controlled by the Society of Ear, Beard, and Foot broklaw gang. If the
party contains demihumans, they are urged to join the EBF. If the party
is entirely human, the gang members inform them that this street belongs
to the EBF and the characters must pay a toll of 10 gp.

If the characters refuse, the leader whistles a signal. Two halflings
appear on the rooftops armed with crossbows while four dwarves shuffle
out of a basement tavern named the Filthy Root and flank the party. If
the characters still refuse, the EBF attacks.

The City Watch arrives in 2d6 rounds to arrest all combatants. One round
before their arrival, the EBF breaks of the attack and retreats through
a hidden tunnel inside the tavern.

**Solomaan Mehdros:** AL N; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 14 (leather armor + Dex);

H1; ML 8; XP 6; 1d4 cp.

#### Labor Strike
A group of laborers are protesting unsafe conditions at a local
guildworks tannery. The laborers have blocked off the street and are not
allowing anyone to pass. If the characters do not find another route,
they may be mistaken for strikebreakers. The real strikebreakers arrive
a few turns later and a huge melee ensues.

**Laborer (42):** treat as 0-level humans with Str 13, AC 9, hp 4, clubs
(Dmg 1d4+1), daggers (Dmg 1d4+1), and 1d4 cp.

strike.

(leather armor), hp 4, clubs (Dmg 1d4+1), and daggers (Dmg 1d4+1). Each
strikebreaker carries the 5 sp they were paid to break the strike.

#### Pack Mules
A long line has formed outside the Laborer&#39;s Guild where an adventuring
company known as the Sunfire Knights of Mor are recruiting porters and
torchbearers for their next trip to the ruins of the Great City of Mor.
The last few trips to the ruins have not ended well for the Sunfire
Knights, and the company was unable to sign up any Adventurer&#39;s Guild
apprentices to accompany them (see [[Isle of Heroes]]).

An impressively armored fighter named Brethan Drake is walking up and
down the line to assess the laborers. Brethan mistakes a PC fighter for
a laborer and asks how much weight he can carry. If the character takes
offense, Brethan challenges him to a duel. The duel is fought to 0 hit
points using &quot;subdual&quot; damage (the loser is knocked unconscious).

**Brethan Drake:** AL N; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 16 (chain mail + *helm of
protection+1*); F3; hp 17; \#AT 1; Dmg 1d8+2 (long sword + Str), 1d4+2

#### Red Mill Rustling
The lower levels of the Red Mill have been overrun with an infestation
of gronted rats, forcing the mill to shut down. A mill foreman named
Walter Tomas recognizes the characters as adventurers and offers them 25
gp each to kill the rats. The rats are scattered throughout the mill in
groups of 1d4.

**Gronted Rat (24):** AL N; MV 60&#39; (20&#39;)/Swim 30&#39; (10&#39;); AC 12 (natural);
HD 2 hit points; hp 2 \#AT 1; Dmg 1d3 (bite); SA bite can cause disease;
SV 0-level human; ML 10; XP 6.

#### Sabotage
A master carpenter named Tolm Larens asks to meet with the characters
privately in a local tavern. Larens claims that the owners of a rival
carpentry guildworks have been intimidating his workers and stealing his
shipments. Larens offers the characters 500 gp to set fire to the rival
factory when no one is present.

If the characters investigate further, they learn that Larens&#39;s former
apprentices left his guildworks voluntarily because they were tired of
his physical abuse.

**Master Tolm Larens:** treat as 0-level human with Str 15, AC 9, hp 3,
dagger (Dmg 1d4), 1d6 gp, and 1d8 sp.

#### Smugglers
The characters are near the Guild Docks where a ship&#39;s cargo is being
assessed by a Treasurer&#39;s Guild tax collector. One of the characters
sees a sailor lowering bundles of goods onto a smaller boat crewed by
two smugglers.

If exposed, the smugglers flee along the river and the tax collector has
the sailor arrested. The characters may have to testify later as to what
they saw. The Treasurer&#39;s Guild may even offer the characters a 250 gp
reward to find and capture the escaped smugglers.

**Smuggler (2):** treat as 0-level humans with AC 9, hp 3, club (Dmg
1d4), dagger (Dmg 1d4), and 1d6 cp.

#### St. James Festival
The characters enter the district during the Festival of St. James the
Builder. During this festival, clergymen of St. James patrol the streets
conscripting citizens to work for an hour in a local shop or guildworks.
After the hour, the citizen is treated to a meal and a round of ale at
the nearest tavern.

Characters who participate in the festival work receive a +1 to all
Reaction rolls made in the Guild District for the remainder of the week.
Characters who refuse to work receive a -1 to all Reaction rolls made in
the Guild District for the next 1d4 weeks.

#### Stampede!
The characters feel the ground shake and hear the rumble of hundreds of
hooves. They have one round to react before a stampeding herd of cattle
rounds the corner and charges in their direction. These cattle were
headed for a guildworks slaughterhouse when they were spooked by a loud
noise.

Characters caught on the street may make a Dexterity check at -2 to duck
into a nearby shop or alleyway. If the check fails, the character is
trampled by the stampede, taking 5d6 hit points of damage before getting
clear.

#### Too Much Weight
The characters see a group of apprentice stonemasons loading a sturdy
wagon with cut stones while a journeyman mason named Dustan Manes barks
orders. One character chosen at random notices the wagon&#39;s axle has
begun to buckle under the weight.

If the PC brings this to Manes&#39;s attention, Manes asks if the character
is a wainwright. If not, Manes thanks the characters, but says he&#39;s sure
the wagon will be fine. A few rounds later, the wagon collapses,
crushing one of the apprentices beneath an avalanche of stones. When
questioned by the guildmaster, Manes denies ever speaking to the PCs.

#### Ultimate Price
The characters hear a scream and the sound of breaking glass from a
glassblower&#39;s shop that is sandwiched between two guildworks factories.
The shop&#39;s doors are locked, the shutters are drawn, and the shop
appears closed.

If the characters enter the shop, they find three broklaw thugs rolling
the body of a glassblower up in a rug. The glassblower was a man named
Ernal Donnan who recently refused to sell his shop to the owner of one
of the neighboring guildworks.

The thugs belong to a small broklaw gang named the Nine Fingers. They
were hired to kill Donnan and make his body disappear. The thugs attack
the characters on sight.

**Nine Fingers Thug (3):** treat as 0-level human with AC 12 (leather
armor), hp 3, short sword (Dmg 1d6), dagger (Dmg 1d4), 1d4 sp, and 1d6
cp.

#### Ball and Cups
A street thief named Aden Crusp has set up a game of &quot;ball and cups&quot; on
a crate and tries to convince the characters to play as they walk by.
Crusp places the ball under one of three cups and then quickly moves the
cups around.

Only one character at a time may stand in front of Crusp and play the
game. This character must make a Wisdom check to determine which cup the
ball is under.

Typical wagers are between 1 gp to 50 gp. Crusp plays the game fair, but
is so skilled that the playing character suffers a -4 to his Wisdom
check (any character not playing the game suffers a -6 to the check).
Crusp&#39;s rather large accomplice, Brono Ladd, is close by to assist if
the PCs cause trouble or refuse to pay.

**Aidan Crusp:** AL N; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 13 (Dex); T3; hp 8; \#AT 1; Dmg

wooden figurine of a bear (25 gp), 1d4 cp.

#### Champions of the Poor
The characters see a group of privileged youths painting phrases such as
&quot;Noble Wealth for Common Folk!&quot;, &quot;The Guilds are Not Your Friends!&quot;, and
&quot;The Duke is the Church is the Guild!&quot; on the wall of a grain merchant&#39;s
warehouse. Other youths harangue the crowd with similar anti-government
rhetoric.

The City Watch arrives in 2d6 rounds to break up the demonstration. When
one of the rowdiest youths is arrested, an attractive girl named Lissa
of Lockeland begs the characters to confront the Watch and free her
friend in the name of justice.

#### Cold Shower
The characters are passing under an aqueduct when it cracks, spilling a
stream of water into the street. Each character must make a saving throw
vs. wands or be swept off his feet and suffer 1d2 hit points damage from
the fall. City Watchmen arrive a short time later to keep onlookers away
as Waterman&#39;s Guild stonemasons reroute the flow and repair the
aqueduct.

#### Divine Fire
An Inquisitor named Father Willem Scorn has cornered an evil magic-user
named Tessa of the Yellow Death on the roof of a three-story apartment
building. Willem planned to capture Tessa, but the sorceress struck him
with a poison staff that turns its victim&#39;s skin yellow. With his dying
breath, the cleric called down a *flame strike* on his enemy.

The characters hear a loud boom and see a column of divine fire strike
the top of the building. As people flee the burning building in panic,
Tessa *feather falls* from the roof and attempts to disappear into the
crowd.

The characters can either help the citizens trapped in the burning
building or try to confront Tessa. Tessa&#39;s clothes are on fire and her
hair is singed. Tessa attacks anyone who tries to stop her, but would
prefer to flee rather than fight.

Willem is later *resurrected* by the Church of Law and Order and resumes
his hunt. If the characters fought Tessa, he may seek them out to
discuss her tactics and capabilities or even ask for their help.

**Tessa of the Yellow Death:** AL C; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 12 (*ring of
protection+1* + Dex); MU5; hp 17 (currently 12); \#AT 1; Dmg 1d6
(*quarterstaff of venom*), 1d4 (dagger); S 9, D 13, C 10, I 14, W 13, Ch

Spells (memorized): 1st: *feather fall* (already cast), *sleep;* 2nd:
*arcane lock, web;* 3rd: *fireball.*

**Father Willem Scorn:** see [[District of Scholars]].

#### Dueling Merchants
A leatherworker named Morrus Sender and a rival leatherworker named
Wallen Weaverson have set up competing stalls across the street from one
another. Morrus offers to sell the characters a suit of leather armor
for 5 gp. Wallen counters by offering a similar suit for 4 gp. When
Morrus angrily responds by dropping the price to 3 gp, Wallen drops his
to 2 gp. Morrus and Wallen both settle on 1 gp and begin to insult one
another. If the characters still refuse to buy the armor, Morrus attacks
Wallen for disrupting his business and chasing off his customers.

**Morrus and Wallen:** treat as 0-level humans with AC 9, 2 hp,
leatherworking shears (Dmg 1d4), and 1d6 cp.

#### Flying Herbersons
The characters see a family troupe of acrobats named the Flying
Herbersons wowing a crowd in a market square with feats such as
cartwheels, back flips, and human pyramids. The patriarch, a wiry man
named Owan Herberson, challenges an agile-looking PC to a test of
balance.

The character must walk the length of a 12&#39; wooden post propped on the
shoulders of two of the stronger Herberson men. The reward is 25 gp, but
the characters may make additional side wagers.

The character must make a Dexterity check at -2 to succeed. Failure
means he loses his balance and falls. The character must make a saving
throw vs. wands to avoid straddling the beam hard, leaving him stunned
and unable to take action for 2d4 rounds. The crowd seems to enjoy this
even more than the troupe&#39;s acrobatics.

#### I Insist
A street vendor named Basel Morrell attempts to sell a bronze brooch to
the characters and won&#39;t take no for an answer. Morrell insists the
characters will need the brooch later, but cannot explain why. Morrell
follows the characters around until they accept the brooch.

Morrell has been *geased* to give the brooch to the characters. Once a
character takes possession of the brooch, he can never be rid of it (it
always magically appears back on his person). The brooch may be a gift
from a powerful NPC, a tracking device made by a powerful villain, or
some other type of plot hook that may foreshadow a future adventure.

#### PC Puppets
The characters see a crowd of children sitting in front of a puppet
stage while a performer named Henry the Puppeteer puts on a show from
beneath a colored cloth. The puppets bear a strong resemblance to the
PCs and may even reenact one of the party&#39;s past adventures (at the
DM&#39;s discretion). If asked, Henry claims to have heard of
the PCs and their exploits from a city crier.

#### Reptile Roundup
An animal handler named Joel the Snake Man has dozens of snakes and
small reptiles on display under a tent in a market square. Joel charges
1 cp for people to walk through the tent and view the exhibits.

A rowdy band of young thugs has forced their way inside the tent without
paying. One of the youths gets too close to an open cage and is bitten
by a poisonous snake. His friends panic and flee, knocking over several
display cases, and a slithering mass of snakes and reptiles spill into
the street.

The characters get caught in the mass of people trying to flee the
market square. Anyone who does not travel with the flow of the crowd
must make a saving throw vs. breath attacks or be knocked down and
trampled for 1d4 points of damage. There is a 50% chance that fallen
characters are attacked by a pit viper.

**Pit Viper:** AL N; MV 90&#39; (30&#39;); AC 14 (natural); HD 2; hp 8 \#AT 1;
Dmg 1d4 (bite) + special; SA bite requires saving throw vs. poison to
avoid death; SV F1; ML 6; XP 38.

#### Stinkfoot
A group of laborers from the Streetsweeper&#39;s Guild is busy clearing
colored streamers, fruit rinds, animal droppings, and other trash from
the gutters after a recent festival. The sweepers use sturdy brooms to
push garbage into the nearest storm drain.

A careless sweeper accidentally slops some of the muck onto a PC&#39;s
clothes. The stench causes the character to suffer a -1 to all Reaction
rolls until he changes clothes. The sweeper is apologetic at first, but
grows angry if insulted. If attacked, the other sweepers quickly come to
his aid.

**Streetsweeper&#39;s Guildsman (8):** treat as 0-level human with AC 9, hp
3, broom (Dmg 1d4), and 1d4 cp.

#### Walk of Sacrifice
The crowd parts as a double column of dozens of robed monks leave the
Valenon and make their way to the Traveler&#39;s Gate. The monks wear
leather armor and carry long swords beneath their robes. The two monks
in the lead carry an ornate shield and an ornate two-handed sword.

This pilgrimage is known as the Walk of Sacrifice where fighting monks
retrace the route of Valen of Vay to the site of the Great Sacrifice on
the borders of the Ghoul Lands. The pilgrimage is held whenever the High
Lawlord declares the need for fighters who are loyal to the church. The
monks call out to PC fighters to join them on the pilgrimage.

#### Worthy Heirs
A manservant named James Cliney stops the PCs on the street and asks if
they are adventurers. If the party says yes, he asks them to meet with
his employer Lord Rupert val Brookwood in the private room of a nearby
tavern.

Lord Brookwood is dying from leprosy and wants to leave his wealth and
property to someone he feels deserves it. If the party accepts,
Brookwood&#39;s alman draws up a will naming the characters his heirs.

The will includes Brookwood&#39;s wealth as well as several properties in
and around Dolmvay. When Lord Brookwood&#39;s estranged children learn of
this, they may attempt to buy the characters off, seek legal action, or
eliminate the characters entirely.

#### Almen Fight
A heated argument between two almen breaks out in the street or at a
local tavern. The dispute concerns the upcoming trial of a baker named
Lorrence of Quarters who is charged with the murder of his wife. The
defensive almen, a man named Janner Arten gets so flustered that he
takes a swing at his rival. The two scholars grapple in the street until
several amused City Watchmen separate them.

Alman Arten recognizes the PCs as adventurers and offers to hire them to
prove his client&#39;s innocence. If the characters begin asking around,
they eventually learn that Lorrence&#39;s wife was having an affair with his
best friend, a soldier named Garrett Hand.

Hand killed the woman in a fit of rage after she attempted to end the
relationship. Hand has since been reassigned to the northern garrison at
Keep Ethelstan, but several neighbors can testify that he was a frequent
visitor while Lorrence was away at work.

#### Bloody Message
The City Watch has recently begun cracking down on several prominent
broklaw gangs, including the Gange Consortium. In response, a City
Watchman is murdered and his mutilated body is dumped in St. Raymont&#39;s
Square. The Watchmen are in an uproar and are determined to bring the
murderer(s) to justice.

#### Brazen Thief
The characters see a thief named Olan Pryor climb the vine-covered walls
of Oldcastle and enter through an open window. The Watchmen appear
skeptical if alerted. A few hours later, a mysterious fire breaks out in
one of the castle&#39;s upper levels. The characters may later be asked to
locate and capture Pryor for questioning.

#### Breakout
The characters overhear a conversation between two broklaw thugs who are
planning to free one of their companions from a public incarceration
cage. The characters can report the thugs to the Watch or try to catch
them in the act.

**Thug (2):** treat as 0-level human with Str 13. treat as 0-level human
with Str 13, AC 9, hp 3, short sword (Dmg 1d6+1), dagger (Dmg 1d4+1),
1d6 cp.

#### Broklaw Mole
The characters see a troop of City Watch cadets march by in formation.
One PC chosen at random realizes that he has seen one of the cadets
before. An Intelligence check at -2 may be made daily. Success means the
character remembers seeing the cadet in an unsavory tavern speaking with
a man rumored to be part of a local broklaw gang.

#### Civic Duty
A street vendor named Wallon Martus sells fresh kebabs in a nearby
market. Martus is currently Wanted by the City Watch after being wrongly
accused of stealing vegetables from a grocer named Bryan Herderson. The
reward for his capture is 10 gp. Martus is an uneducated man who is
easily confused by big words. He knows he cannot evade the Watch
forever, but has no money to hire an alman.

Martus asks the PCs to present his case at court. If the PCs refuse,
Martus is eventually captured by the Watch and thrown in the dungeons.
If the PCs agree to represent Martus, Herderson does not appear in court
and the case is dismissed. If the PCs seek out Herderson, they see a
gang of street urchins stealing his vegetables.

Either way, word quickly spreads that the party was willing to help
Martus, and the characters can expect goodwill from the common folk.
This is a good way to introduce the PCs to the complexities of Dolmvay
law.

#### Crazed Prophet
An emaciated madman has been imprisoned in a public cage for harassing
citizens. The madman slips into a trance and begins recounting some of
the party&#39;s past exploits, current goals, and future deeds. The madman
disappears from the cage after one day and is not seen again. No one
else at the watchpost remembers his imprisonment. The DM can
use this encounter to foreshadow future events.

#### Final Swindle
A conman named &quot;Honest&quot; Merle Driver has been convicted of theft and
fraud and sentenced to 10 days public incarceration in the stocks. As
Honest Merle is secured in the stocks, he begs the Watchmen to place him
in a jail cell instead. Honest Merle appears terrified and makes several
references to a &quot;She&quot; that he claims will come for him after dark.

Merle was hired by a vampiress named Leona Halworth to buy several
properties throughout the city on behalf of her master, the vampire
Garendal Wurrik. Merle swindled Leona out of her money before realizing
she was not human. Before he could make amends, Merle was arrested on
other theft and fraud charges.

If the characters return after nightfall, Leona arrives at the stocks to
drain Merle&#39;s life energy. Otherwise, the characters find out the next
day that Honest Merle died mysteriously during the night.

**&quot;Honest&quot; Merle Driver:** treat as 0-level human with Int 13, Cha 13,
AC 9, and hp 2.

**Leona Halworth (vampiress):** AL C; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;)/Fly 180&#39; (60&#39;); AC 2

sunlight, immune to normal weapons, 1/2 damage from electricity- and
cold-based attacks, immunity to spells (*charm, sleep*, and *hold*
spells); SV F7; ML 9; XP 3,150.

#### Heads Will Roll
The characters see a crowd gathering in St. Raymont&#39;s Square to watch
the execution of a violent rapist and murderer named Darvon &quot;Three
Drinks&quot; Curter. The execution is handled as a gala event with jugglers,
musicians, and street vendors catering to the gathered crowd.

Curter is driven out on a cart and pelted with rotten fruit, eggs, and
vegetables. Friends and relatives of the victims curse Curter as a Watch
Captain reads off a list of his crimes. Curter is then brought before
the hooded executioner and the Watch Captain asks if he has any last
words.

Defiant to the last, Curter spits at the captain&#39;s feet. Curter is
forced into position and the crowd gasps as the headsman&#39;s axe separates
Curter&#39;s head from his shoulders. The crowd applauds.

#### Rogue Adventurers
A Watch Sergeant offers the characters 50 gp each to help escort a
prisoner from Oldcastle to Dungeon Rock. The prisoner is a thief named
Bears of Tallrock who is part of an adventuring company known as the
Watchers of the Gray Ice. Bears has been convicted of killing four City
Watchmen during a night of drunken revelry.

The Watch has just received word that Bears&#39;s companions planned to
break him out of the Oldcastle Dungeons. They decided to move him to the
more secure prison at Dungeon Rock to await trial. If the characters
agree to help, the procession is attacked before it reaches the River
Docks.

**Watchers of the Gray Ice:** see [[Baytown]] for statistics.

#### Secret Tunnel
While passing down a side street or alley, one character chosen at
random feels the cobblestone street beneath his feet start to give way.
The character must make a saving thow vs. wands to leap clear of the
street before it crumbles away. If not, the character falls through the
hole, suffering 1d6 hit points of damage.

The hole opens on a crudely dug tunnel. If the characters investigate,
they find that the tunnel leads from the cellar of an abandoned
stonemason&#39;s shop to a dead end. If the wall at the dead end is removed,
the characters find themselves in the Dungeons of Oldcastle.

The tunnel was dug by members of a broklaw gang who were killed by City
Watchmen during a raid on their hideout. No one currently living is
aware that the tunnel exists.

#### Treasures of Oldtower
A grimy beggar named Stevon Crenell calls to the PCs from a dark alley.
Crenell tells the party that he went into the ruins of Oldtower last
night to seek shelter. While there, he heard noises coming from an upper
floor and decided to investigate. His next memory was waking up in this
alley.

Crenell claims he dreamt of a chest full of gold coins and other
trinkets waiting to be found in Oldtower. He wants the PCs to check out
the tower and cut him in for a share of the profits.

The DM is free to decide what waits for the PCs within the
ruined tower—Crenell may have stumbled upon a secret hoard, he may be
insane, or he may have been sent to lure the PCs into an ambush.

#### Church Service
The High Lawlord gives a sermon from his balcony overlooking St. Poul&#39;s
Square. The sermon emphasizes the duty of all worshipers to dedicate
time, skills, and wealth for the betterment of the church. The square is
choked with emotional worshipers who fill the air with chants,
affirmations, and heartfelt prayers.

#### Dovecrow Square
The characters see thousands of dovecrows gathering in St. Poul&#39;s
Square. The birds take to the air with raucous cries if pestered.

#### Express the Faith
Father Carden Wells stops the characters with a simple greeting common
to followers of Law and Order. Neutral and Chaotic characters may make
an Intelligence check at -2 to know the proper response.

If the PCs seem to have trouble answering, Father Carden questions them
further about matters of the faith and makes several references to the
holy book known as *The Guiding Light*.

If Father Carden believes the majority of the PCs are not
Lawfully-aligned, he contacts the Hiltamen and has them watched. If the
PCs seem to be Lawfully-aligned, he may start keeping track of their
exploits and attempt to recruit them at a later date.

**Father Carden Wells:** see [[The Valenon]] for statistics.

#### False Relic
A street vendor named Ian Broan attempts to sell the characters a shard
of metal he claims to be part of the legendary Sword of Valen, which was
sundered during the time of the Great Sacrifice. Ian keeps the shard
wrapped in a piece of tattered cloth. He is asking 500 gp, but can be
talked down to almost any amount. The shard radiates magic to a *detect
magic* spell, but is otherwise a normal piece of metal.

#### Festival of St. Clarissa
The characters arrive at the Valenon during the Festival of St. Clarissa
the Wild. In addition to the normal festivities, animal handlers put on
shows and animal vendors attempt to sell puppies, kittens, small birds,
and other young animals to the characters.

#### Funeral Procession
A funeral procession for a pious nobleman named Lord Nuren val Deertral
is making its way through the Valenon to the Cathedral of St. Poul. The
procession consists of priests in ceremonial armor, Hiltamen, and family
and friends of Lord Deertral escorting his coffin.

Church bells toll when the coffin reaches the sanctuary and a memorial
is held in Lord Deertral&#39;s honor. After the funeral, Lord Deertral&#39;s
remains are prepared for placement in the Catacombs of the Dead. Valenon
funerals are considered public events that anyone may attend.

#### Guiding Light
On a cloudy day, the clouds suddenly part and a ray of sunlight falls
upon the Cathedral of St. Poul. The faithful see this as a sign from the
forces of Law and Order and immediately fall to their knees and recite
prayers. Characters who do not react in kind may be viewed with
suspicion.

#### Marriage Ceremony
Father Gabrel Sorlund is presiding over the marriage of a wealthy
merchant named Elias don Leister to his bride the Lady Mairi vala
Hemmsley. The marriage was arranged after the Hemmsley Family fell on
hard times and the festivities are marred by an overall feeling of
gloom.

Lady Mairi looks particularly unhappy. Her true love is a poor young
scholar named Kristoff Penderal.

About halfway through the proceedings, Kristoff leads a band of
privileged youths into St. Poul&#39;s Square to protest the arranged
marriage. Kristoff and his friends are quickly detained and removed by a
contingent of Hiltamen and the marriage ceremony continues, but this may
set the stage for further intrigues.

#### Pilgrimage of St. Raymont
A procession of chanting pilgrims makes their way through the Valenon.
These pilgrims are members of a small faction known as the Sins of St.
Raymont. The pilgrims believe that self-punishment is the only path to
true salvation. They proceed to St. Poul&#39;s Square, disrobe from the
waist up, and then began flagellating themselves with leather whips. The
ceremony ends when the High Lawlord appears in his balcony and offers a
blessing to the exhausted pilgrims.

#### Song of the Serphala
Church bells ring and a flock of seven serphala alight on their perches
around St. Poul&#39;s Square. The bells ring again and the serphala begin a
hauntingly beautiful song that causes the faithful to fall to their
knees and weep. The bells ring a third time and the serphala return to
the Holy Aerie.

#### Vandals
The characters see acolytes busy scrubbing the image of a sickle that
has been painted upon the base of a statue of St. James the Elder. If
the characters ask, they learn the sickle is one of several symbols
associated with the false nature religion known as the Druun. No one
knows who vandalized the statue.

#### Zombie Mass
The characters hear a commotion from a nearby storm grate. A few moments
later, a pack of six zombies push the grate aside, clamber out, and
attack anyone in sight.

These zombies were animated by agents of the vampire lord Garendal
Wurrik. Characters who assist in killing the zombies are whisked away to
a private meeting with Father Vayon Conners where he advises them not to
speak of undead to anyone else.

#### Blind Artist
A blind, deaf, and dumb painter named Blind Valer is painting an
awe-inspiring mural of the ancient City of Mor on the wall of a
building. If the characters find some way to communicate with Blind
Valer, they learn that he paints images from his dreams.

#### Dumb Brute
A group of privileged youths led by a young noble named Erelk val
Devoncrest invites the largest PC fighter to the House of Albritton for
a free round of drinks. The youths speak in small words and use slow,
deliberate tones as they ask the fighter to recount his latest exploits.
They believe that all adventuring fighters are uncivilized brutes that
are easily provoked to anger. If the character protests, the terrified
youths beg for their lives.

**Erelk val Devoncrest**: treat as 0-level human with Cha 13, AC 9, hp
2, dagger (Dmg 1d4), gold necklace (100 gp), 2 gold rings (50 gp), 1d6

#### Gallery Thief
A band of thieves has targeted a painting by the legendary artist Antoni
Mollins (worth 3,000 gp) that hangs in a high-end art gallery. One of
the thieves distracts the gallery owner while another cuts the painting
out of its frame and places it into a scroll tube.

Outside the gallery, one character chosen at random happens to notice a
scroll tube being handed off between several different people. A few
moments later, the gallery owner runs into the street shouting cries of
&quot;Thief!&quot;.

The owner&#39;s name is Marten Westhall. He gives the characters a
description of the thief and offers a 100 gp reward to track down and
return the painting. The thief and his companions can be found boarding
a boat at the nearby River District docks. The thieves belong to the
Thieves&#39; Guild and prefer to flee rather than fight. If confronted, one
of the thieves attempts to distract the characters by throwing an empty
scroll tube into the river.

**Thief (5):** AL N; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 13 (Dex); T2; hp 5; \#AT 1; Dmg

cumulative chance that each captured thief has the stolen painting.

#### Ghoul&#39;s Out
Kavin Hester owned a small private library known as the Library of
Rivell. A few days ago, Hester was rearranging books in the library&#39;s
cellar when he accidentally knocked over a bookshelf and was crushed to
death. Hester reanimated as a ghoul, but remained trapped beneath the
fallen shelf.

One of Hester&#39;s friends discovered the body today. Thinking the ghoul
was his injured friend, he moved the shelf, only to be killed and
devoured by the ravenous ghoul. The ghoul then went on a rampage in the
streets.

The characters hear screams and see a crowd of scholars, shop owners,
and students fleeing the area. The ghoul attacks anyone in sight. If the
characters do nothing, a Lawguardian and four City Watchmen arrive in
2d4 rounds to dispatch the monster.

**Ghoul:** AL C; MV 90&#39; (30&#39;); AC 14 (natural); HD 2; hp 8 \#AT 3; Dmg

#### Library Find
A scholar named Worler of Garrus Park has discovered the entrance to a
secret underground library complex located beneath the Library of
Torbett. Worler is frightened by some of the strange sounds he has heard
coming from the tunnels and offers the characters 50 gp to protect him
while he examines the ancient tomes. The sounds may be nothing, or the
tunnels may lead to a further dungeon-based adventure, if the Labyrinth
Lord desires.

#### Mad Larian
The characters see an inventor named Larian the Mad standing on top of
one of the Halls of Learning. Larian has crafted a set of bird wings out
of wood and feathers and believes he has unlocked the secret of flight.
A crowd has gathered to watch the spectacle. Some shout for him to come
to his senses and get off the roof while others accuse him of being a
sorcerer and hurl stones and rotted fruit.

If the characters do nothing, Larian jumps to his death. Larian&#39;s
apartment contains a number of scrolls depicting various inventions, and
there are those who believe that he was a man ahead of his time. The
church denounces Larian&#39;s scrolls as blasphemous and orders them burned,
but some of his designs may reappear in the future.

#### Nude Model
An artist named Brianna of Kingsgarden is doing a study on a particular
adventuring class (chosen at random). Brianna asks one of the PCs to
pose for a portrait. If the PC agrees, she sets up an easel near a local
park and sketches the character in a dramatic pose. Breanna then asks
the character to recreate that pose in the nude. If the PC agrees, the
party receives a +1 to all Reaction rolls made in the District of
Scholars for the next month.

#### Ogruk Slave
The characters see a group of scholars from the Healer&#39;s Guild examining
an ogruk chained to a stone dais. The ogruk&#39;s name is Trok and he is the
property of a nobleman named Mattius mor Dredward.

Trok is clad in a simple loincloth and his body is covered in scars from
burns and the lash. He is on loan to the Healer&#39;s Guild so they can
examine the extent of his past injuries and his resilience.

Trok is busy munching on a hunk of raw mutton, but is getting tired of
being poked and prodded. Although he has been beaten into submission, he
is still subject to occasional fits of violence and rage.

**Trok (ogruk):** AL N; MV 90&#39; (30&#39;); AC 15 (natural); HD 4+1; hp 26;
\#AT 1; Dmg 1d10 (broken chain); SV F4; ML 8; XP 215.

#### Playing With Fire
A heretofore unknown minstrel named Berton of Merony performs an
irreverent song in a local park. The song suggests the &quot;Lord of the
Wall&quot; and the &quot;Lord of Them All&quot; are lovers in the &quot;Bedroom of White&quot;.
Although not stated explicitly, these seem to be references to the Duke
of Valnwall, the High Lawlord, and the City of Dolmvay.

The crowd&#39;s reaction is mixed—some are outraged, but most are amused by
the minstrel&#39;s clever turn of phrase. A Lawguardian and two City
Watchmen arrive a short time later to question everyone in the area and
attempt to locate this Berton of Merony.

**Berton of Merony:** treat as 0-level human with Ch 15, AC 9, hp 2,
dagger (Dmg 1d4), 1d6 sp, 1d8 cp. Berton is actually a member of the
Society of the Swan.

#### Sewer Trek
An alchemist named Derrigan the Bottler has discovered what he believes
to be a recipe that accelerates normal healing. One of the key
ingredients is a reddish colored fungus known as chatrel slime that grows deep in Dolmvay&#39;s sewers. Derrigan offers the characters
200 gp to recover a jarful of the slime. The trip into the sewers is
sure to be fraught with danger.

#### Taste of Philosophy
The PCs see a group of young men and women gathered around a fountain,
listening to a philosopher named Vinthus Tralento. Vinthus hails the
adventurers and asks: &quot;What is it that drives an adventurer? Is it the
promise of fame? Fortune? Or is it the thrill of the adventure itself?&quot;

No matter what the characters answer, Vinthus addresses his students and
says: &quot;You see? There is a lesson here. Even in a kingdom where lands
and titles are used to define your worth to society, there are ways to
rise above your station. Such is the true glory of the age we live in.&quot;

**Vinthus Tralento:** see [[District of Scholars]] for statistics.

#### Veiled Scribe
One character chosen at random accidentally bumps into a veiled woman,
dislodging her veil. Any PC who makes an Intelligence check at -2
recognizes her as Lady Elena vala Dolm the Royal Scribe who is traveling
without her Iron Wolf bodyguards.

Lady Elena is on a secret mission to speak with Windmaster Bryan
Sturlaker. She apologizes to the character as she replaces her veil and
then hurriedly darts through the nearest doorway. If the PCs follow her,
they find only an empty room.

#### Courtly Proceedings
Duke Robert val Dolm is personally hearing grievances at court. If the
characters attend, they see all manner of nobles, merchants, and
commoners engaging in intrigues and vying for the Duke&#39;s attention.
During the proceedings, a group of representatives from the small town
of Tarshold claim that half the town has been swallowed up by a strange
sinkhole and the townsfolk fear sorcery is at work. The Duke puts out an
open call for adventurers wishing to investigate the occurrence.

#### Fair Practice
The Duke&#39;s nephew Lord Armon val Dolm was severely wounded in an honor
duel with a nobleman named Lord Westley mor Apperson. The PCs see Lord
Armon being carried on a shield to the Chapel of St. Valen. The
DM must decide whether or not the priests heal Lord Armon
before the last Son&#39;s Day of the month (as per church doctrine). The
nobles are furious if the clergymen choose to wait, while the common
folk protest if they do not.

#### Gundamark Dwarves
The characters see an entourage of grim-faced Gundamark dwarves clad in
chain mail and carrying battle axes, hammers, and war clubs. Onlookers
scramble out of the way as the formidable troop tromps past.

If the party contains a dwarf, the dwarves stop to talk. They are
concerned about recent gatherings of ruks in the Ruklands to the
northeast and have come to seek aid from the Duke.

#### Healing for All
A revered philosopher named Darrlon Holt has been persecuted for
speaking out against church practices. Darrlon believes that the church
is a place of healing and that the priests should not be so selective
with curative magic. Darrlon has decided to draw attention to his cause
by jumping off the Kingsbridge.

The characters see a crowd gathered at the foot of the bridge as a group
of Ducal Guardsmen makes their way towards Darrlon. The PCs can learn
from the crowd what is happening. Unless the party intervenes, Darrlon
jumps to his death just as the guardsmen reach the platform. His body is
recovered downriver and his students and followers petition the church
for his resurrection.

#### Holk Halflings
The characters see an entourage of light-hearted Holk halflings dressed
in brightly colored finery and carrying walking sticks (clubs) and
daggers. Many onlookers stop to chuckle at the stunted mob.

If the party contains a halfling, the Holk stop to talk. They are part
of a wandering clan known as the Nimblemen Holk that have come to
petition the Duke for land rights.

worth 1d6 x 10 gp each, 1d6 sp.

#### Metallic Visitor
The characters hear cries of alarm as fingers point skyward towards a
bronze dragon that is lazily circling high above the Ducal Palace. The
Ducal Guard scrambles to man the defenses as the rest of the palace&#39;s
inhabitants seek shelter. The sound of a strange horn resonates from
somewhere in the city. In response, the dragon breathes lightning into
the sky and then slowly flies east.

#### Price of Treason
A poisoner named Bommel Mills was captured after a failed attempt to
assassinate the Royal Scribe. Bommel was unable to describe who hired
him and has been sentenced to torture and execution for treason.

A large crowd gathers to watch the event in an inner bailey of the ducal
palace. The characters must leave their weapons outside if they wish to
enter. Inside, street vendors hawk their wares and performers entertain
the crowd.

At noon, a beaten and bedraggled Bommel is escorted from the dungeons to
the executioner&#39;s platform. The Wolflord reads off a list of Bommel&#39;s
crimes before a hooded executioner subjects him to all manner of grisly
tortures. The torture is an extended event. When Bommel passes out from
the pain, the executioner revives him with a bucket of water and gives
him a few moments to recover.

When Bommel at last cannot be revived, his neck is placed on the
chopping block and his head is removed from his shoulders. The young
Duke impassively watches the entire event from a balcony above.

#### Saboteur
The characters see a man *feather fall* from the riverside walls of the
Ducal Palace and then dive into the Dolm River. A few moments later,
they hear shouts of &quot;Fire!&quot; and see smoke billowing from one of the
royal granaries. The fire is quickly extinguished, but not before
causing damage to the city stores. The PCs later hear that the Order of
Karth has taken responsibility for the sabotage.

#### Shapeshifter
A doppleganger has been hired to kill a court nobleman named Lord
Ganther val Hummbridge. The doppleganger lures a Ducal Guardsman into a
closet, storeroom, or outbuilding and then kills him.

The characters are passing by when they hear the sounds of a brief
struggle coming from inside the room. The door opens a few moments later
and the doppleganger walks out disguised as a Ducal Guardsman.

If the characters check the room, they find the real guardsman&#39;s corpse
hidden beneath a pile of linens. If the characters kill the
doppleganger, they find a scroll containing Lord Hummbridge&#39;s daily
itinerary. If brought to the nobleman&#39;s attention, Lord Hummbridge
attempts to hire the PCs for protection.

**Doppleganger:** AL C; MV 90&#39; (30&#39;); AC 15 (natural); HD 4; hp 19 \#AT

#### Tourney
A festive tournament takes place on the palace greens. Competitions
include jousting, archery, and swordsmanship. The Duke and his entourage
watch the event from a private booth. At the end of the tourney, the
Duke bestows knighthoods on several loyal squires.

#### Vanhurr Elves
The characters see an entourage of stately Vanhurr elves dressed in
woodland finery and armed with slender spears, ornate wooden shields,
elvish scimitars, and elvish longbows. Onlookers stop to gaze at the
beauty of the elvish procession.

If the party contains an elf, the elves stop to talk. They are concerned
about recent rumblings from the Wastelands of Aal to the west and have
come to seek aid from the Duke.

ML 8; XP 100; 1d4 pieces of random jewelry worth 1d6 x 25 gp each, 1d10
gp.

#### Xannen Ambassador
A foreign entourage from the Empire of Xanne arrives at the Ducal Docks.
The raven-and-arrow banner of Xanne has not been seen in Dolmvay for
years and their arrival causes a huge commotion. Shouts, curses, and
even stones begin to fly at the heavily armed visitors.

The characters see several black-robed Xannen wizards making arcane
motions with their hands. The Ducal Guard quickly breaks up the angry
mob and escorts the ambassadors directly to the palace for a meeting
with the Duke and his Council. Rumors begin to fly and no story is too
outrageous to be refuted.

A young man named Kean Demberon is rebelling against the teachings of
the church and his merchant father. The characters see Kean throw a
bucket of paint onto a statue of St. Marcus the Orator. Kean runs
through the startled crowd and then darts down a side street. If the
characters apprehend Kean, his father Trakean don Demberon arrives with
several private bodyguards and offers the characters 50 gp to release
Kean into his custody. Trakean promises that Kean will repair the statue
and be punished for the vandalism.

#### Ape Idol
A lame beggar named &quot;Limps&quot; has decided to loot the abandoned temple of
an ancient jungle god. While rummaging through a vine-covered courtyard,
Limps knocks over a crumbling idol, unleashing a magical trap.

The characters hear a scream and a commotion from inside the temple. If
they investigate, they find three man-eating apes feasting on Limps&#39;s
corpse. The apes attack on sight.

#### Charming Courtesan
A classy and alluring young woman named Delanna of Guildeland flirts
with one of the characters at a local tavern. If the character seems
interested, Delanna gives the PC her address and offers to meet there in
one hour, after she has had a chance to freshen up. The PC arrives at
that address to discover it is the high-end brothel known as the House
of Melius. Delanna awaits the character inside. Her price is not cheap,
but she is worth every gold piece the character spends.

#### Commotion at the Coliseum
The characters see preparations being made for a large event at the
Dolmvay Coliseum. An army of laborers from various guilds are hard at
work building stages, repairing stonework, and mapping out vendor&#39;s
stalls. The preparations may be for an upcoming performance, festival,
or tournament of the DM&#39;s choosing.

#### Decoy Escort
A nobleman named Lord Aren val Strahl is enjoying an afternoon&#39;s respite
in the Siren&#39;s Call bathhouse when an &quot;associate&quot; informs him he has
been targeted by assassins. Lord Strahl sends his vassal, a knight named
Sir Wynnston Manerlon, to locate a party of adventurers looking for
work.

Sir Wynnston approaches the PCs on the street and guides them to a
private sauna inside the Siren&#39;s Call bathhouse. Here, a very naked Lord
Strahl offers the PCs 100 gp each to escort him from the sauna to his
home in the District of Nobles.

If the characters agree, Lord Strahl sends Sir Manerlon ahead to scout
for enemies while he swathes himself from head to foot in plate armor
and meets the characters outside. This Lord Strahl is actually a decoy.

The party is attacked en route by a band of thugs led by a female
magic-user named Raltha of the Painted Nails. If captured, Raltha
confesses that she was hired by a rival nobleman named Theon mor
Andrews. Raltha is imprisoned by the Watch, but is murdered in her cell
before ever reaching trial.

#### Fugitive Sorcerer

The characters see four City Watchmen draw swords and surround a man
named Kertis of Pig Street. Kertis is a magic-user who has been wrongly
accused of murder. Kertis casts a *sleep* spell on the Watchmen and then
darts down a side street. If captured, Kertis offers to inform on the
real murderer, a brutal broklaw gang leader named Weeping Will.

**Kertis of Pig Street:** see [[Guild District]] for statistics.

#### Hero Worship
A group of privileged youths led by a merchant&#39;s son named Orik
Haimbridge asks the characters to write their names or marks on a
makeshift banner. The youths then invite the party for drinks at the
Citizen&#39;s Tower tavern where the characters are asked to recount some of
their greatest adventures. Orik and his friends pay for all food and
drinks and may appear on a future date, telling stories about the PCs&#39;
exploits or cheering them on after their latest adventure.

#### High Fashion
A wealthy merchant named Barster don Gailes has commissioned a local
guildworks to embroider adventurer-related designs on the hems of robes
and tunics. The designs consist of swords (for fighters), holy hilts
(for clerics), keyholes (for thieves), and spirals (for magic-users).
Gailes approaches the characters in the street and offers to pay them
100 gp each to model the clothing in a public show at the City Center
Docks.

#### Make Way!
The characters hear the sound of dozens of hoof beats thundering towards
them and hear cries of &quot;Make way! Make way!&quot;. The crowd parts as the
Vaultkeeper surrounded by an escort of two Iron Wolf knights and twenty
mounted soldiers gallop down the street in the party&#39;s direction.

Any character who refuses to move is automatically knocked to the ground
and trampled for 5d6 hit points of damage. If the party attempts to stop
the procession, one Iron Wolf and ten mounted soldiers attack while the
Vaultkeeper and the remainder of his escort continue on to the Ducal
Palace.

**Vaultkeeper:** see [[Palatial District]] for statistics.

#### Sewer Trouble
A team of six laborers from the Sewerman&#39;s Guild are unblocking a
section of the city&#39;s magical sewers when the walls shift, sealing two
of the men in a chamber with no exit. The characters feel the street
rumble shortly before they see two Sewermen scramble out of the nearest
storm grate. The Sewermen ask the characters for help tearing down the
wall. The noise attracts the attention of a pack of gronted hounds.

**Gronted Hound (6):** AL N; MV 150&#39; (50&#39;); AC 14 (natural); HD 1+2; hp

#### Snake Cult
The characters see a large crowd gathering near a shrine on Temple
Street. If they investigate, they see an unkempt, bearded man in robes
holding a large constrictor snake. The man&#39;s name is &quot;The Gorgon&quot; and he
claims to be a prophet of a new snake cult known as the Order of Shala.
The snake he possesses is actually a magical creature. Anyone who gazes
into the snake&#39;s eyes must make a saving throw vs. spells or fall under
the effects of a *suggestion* spell.

A Lawguard and four City Watchmen arrive a short time later to break up
the gathering. The enchanted crowd turns on the surprised Watchmen for
1d6 rounds, allowing the Gorgon to escape in the confusion.

#### Supercilious Sculptor
The characters see three burly laborers hoisting a statue of St. Tara
the Sailor onto a fountain pedestal while a sculptor named Galeddo looks
on. Galeddo is arrogant, vain, and easily annoyed. If approached, he
acts as if talking to the characters is a waste of his time. If the
characters express interest or knowledge of art, Galeddo&#39;s demeanor
becomes much more friendly.

**Galeddo:** treat as 0-level human with Dex 15, AC 12 (Dex), dagger (Dmg

#### Afraid of Shadows
A paranoid nobleman named Tarter mor Habershall fears for his life.
Earlier today, he hired a party of Northwarden adventurers to escort him
to the Habershall Dock. However, Lord Habershall slowly began to suspect
the adventurers planned to betray him and dismissed them at the last
moment. His manservant Domas Niles hails the PCs as they pass Habershall
Manor and offers them 100 gp each to immediately escort his master to
the docks. The trip is uneventful. The DM may use this
encounter to introduce the PCs to the eccentric Lord Habershall.

#### Angry Elephant
The characters hear a commotion on the street ahead and see several
animal handlers leading a costumed elephant. The elephant was imported
by a nobleman named Lord Gerald mor Alveon and is part of an upcoming
feast meant to celebrate his lucrative ventures in the jungle lands of
Mujabi.

The elephant is spooked by all the fuss and trumpets a warning to the
crowd, causing neighborhood dogs to bark and horses to rear. Any
character riding or leading a horse must make a Wisdom check in order to
keep his mount from bolting. A spooked horse causes the elephant to
panic and go on a rampage. If the elephant is killed, Lord Alveon may
desire compensation.

**Elephant:** AL N; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 15 (natural); HD 9; hp 63 \#AT 2 or
1; Dmg 2d4 (tusk)/2d4 (tusk) or 4d8 (trample); SA attempt to trample on
roll of 1-3 on 1d4, +4 to-hit when trampling human-sized creature or
smaller; SV F5; ML 8; XP 2,400.

#### Brazen Insult
The characters see a workforce of guild laborers using teams of oxen to
hoist a sleek sailing ship onto a tall pedestal outside the home of Lord
Scolt val Barlingten. The ship, the *Wind Dragon*, was once the pride of
a rival noble named Lord Berkel mor Torrin whose family has fallen on
hard times. After purchasing the vessel for far less than its value,
Lord Barlingten has decided to mount it for all to see.

#### Deceiver Attack

The characters hear the sound of sobbing coming from a nearby alley. If
they investigate they see a young boy leaning against a wall with his
face buried in his arms. The &quot;boy&quot; is actually the pseudopod of a
deceiver. The deceiver attacks any character who approaches.

**Deceiver:** AL C; MV 30&#39; (10&#39;); AC 13 (natural); HD 5; hp 25 \#AT 1;
Dmg 2d4 (pseudopod) + special; SA sticky pseudopod requires a Strength
check at -4 to break free; SV MU5; ML 8; XP 500.

#### Dread Dalion
The characters hear an ear-piercing shriek. Citizens on the street make
the sign of the holy hilt to ward off evil and glance nervously towards
the Thirteen Spires of House Dalion. If the characters ask, they learn
that the shrieks are the tormented cries of the Mad Lady Dalion wailing
for her lost children.

#### Grim Message
The character see the corpse of a young man hanged from the Arch of
Crows. The man was the only son and heir of the merchant Walton don
Buttersly. Word of the hanging spreads throughout the city. The other
merchant families are up in arms over the boy&#39;s murder and are willing
to pay several thousand gold pieces to apprehend his killers.

If the characters get involved, they learn that the Buttersly Family was
recently thwarted after secretly attempting to purchase a manor home on
the edge of the District of Nobles. The common sentiment among the
nobility is that the Buttersly Family attempted to rise too far above
its station and was punished.

#### Mistaken Identity
The characters are passing through the District of Nobles when shouts of
&quot;Thief!&quot; ring out. A patrol of Halstead Watchmen rushes up and attempts
to detain the characters. If the characters resist, they may face the
full weight of the law. If they comply, they are placed in manacles and
seated on the curb. A Watch Sergeant arrives a few rounds later and
frees the PCs with a sincere apology.

**Halstead Watchmen (4):** treat as 0-level humans with AC 15 (chain
mail), hp 3, long sword (Dmg 1d8), dagger (Dmg 1d4), 1d4 sp, and 1d6 cp.

#### Noble Duel
The characters see the entourages of two rival nobles squaring off in
the street. One entourage is led by the young Lord Petros val Tamberly
while the other is led by Lord Varlen val Mastwell. The entourages hurl
catcalls and insults at each other before Lord Tamberly challenges Lord
Mastwell to a duel.

The two draw swords and begin to fight (using subdual rules). A group of
four Halstead Watchmen arrive as the duel begins, only to make sure the
crowd does not get unruly. The winner of the duel gives quarter to the
loser, but the duel is talked about throughout the city.

**Lord Petros val Tamberly:** treat as 0-level human with Str 13, AC 9,
hp 4, long sword (Dmg 1d8), dagger (Dmg 1d4), gold and silver Tamberly
necklace (500 gp), 35 gp, 24 sp, and 13 cp.

**Lord Varlen val Mastwell:** treat as 0-level human with Dex 13, AC 8
(Dex), hp 3, long sword (Dmg 1d8), dagger (Dmg 1d4), gold Mastwell
necklace (500 gp), 21 gp, 22 sp, and 27 cp.

**Halstead Watchman (4):** treat as 0-level humans with AC 15 (chain
mail), hp 3, long sword (Dmg 1d8), dagger (Dmg 1d4), 1d4 sp, and 1d6 cp.

#### Noble Picnic
The characters see several noble entourages gathering in Halidyne Park
for a festive afternoon picnic. The event is invitation-only. A group of
burly Halstead Watchmen guard the entrances to this section of the park
and the PCs must sneak by or bluff their way inside if they wish to
attend.

Once inside, they are treated to specially prepared delicacies, courtly
dances, and inspirational performances (from musicians, storytellers,
poets, etc.). A member of the royal family or perhaps even the Duke
himself may stop by to partake of the festivities. The DM
can use this event to introduce the characters to courtly dramas and
intrigues.

**Halstead Watchman (4):** treat as 0-level humans with AC 15 (chain
mail), hp 3, long sword (Dmg 1d8), dagger (Dmg 1d4), 1d4 sp, and 1d6 cp.

#### Pagon Chant
The characters hear a haunting call to prayer ring out over the
district. This is the voice of Lord Korley val Berrien chanting a prayer
in the language of the Baladi desert tribesmen. The characters are
welcome to come and pray with val Berrien at his small mosque, if they
are so inclined.

#### Watchmen Watching
The characters realize they are being followed by two Halstead Watchmen.
If the characters are dressed well, the Watchmen are trying to determine
to which adventuring company they belong. If the characters look like
riffraff, the Watchmen are making sure they are not causing problems.

**Halstead Watchman (2):** treat as 0-level humans with AC 15 (chain
mail), hp 3, long sword (Dmg 1d8), dagger (Dmg 1d4), 1d4 sp, and 1d6 cp.

#### Wealthy Diversions
An entourage led by a smiling young nobleman named Lord Tristen val
Parlee stops the characters in the street and offers a fighter character
100 gp for his sword. The nobles are participating in a scavenger hunt,
and the sword of an adventuring fighter is one of the items on their
list. If Lord Parlee wins the contest (DM&#39;s discretion), he
invites the PCs to an elaborate victory feast.

# NEW FLORA AND FAUNA

&gt; &quot;The song of the serphala reminds us that there is beauty in Law.&quot;  
&gt; —Friar Josep Arledge

## NEW FLORA

&gt; &quot;The sewers of Dolmvay are full of life. I&#39;ve discovered strains of
&gt; moss, fungi, and lichens that cannot be found anywhere else.&quot;  
&gt; —Willow Greer (the Mushroom Sage)

The following unusual flora may be found in and around the City of
Dolmvay.

### Blue Kelp

Blue kelp is an edible seaweed found in parts of Kingsbay. Blue kelp can
be combined with several other herbs to make a bitter-tasting tea. When
ingested, this tea provides +1 to saving throws vs. poison for the next
1d4 hours.

### Chatrel Slime

Chatrel slime is a reddish fungus that grows deep in the bowels of
Dolmvay&#39;s magical sewer system. The slime has mild healing properties.
When rubbed on an open wound, the character immediately regains 1d2 hit
points. This healing effect can only be used once per day.

### Creeper Vines

A creeper vine is a hardy climbing vine that grows quickly if left
untended. Creeper vines cover many old walls, buildings, and statues in
Dolmvay, adding +20% to a thief&#39;s chance to climb walls. The vines grow
to a length of 50&#39; or more and are strong enough to be used as ropes for
climbing or restraints. Thicker creeper vines are sometimes dried out
and fashioned into clubs or quarterstaffs.

### Darsenthe

Darsenthe is a fluorescent yellow fungus that grows in the deepest
levels of the Dolmvay sewers. The fungus produces mild hallucinations in
humans and has been known to drive elves insane. Darsenthe is harvested
by dwarves and fermented to make the heady brew known as Dwarf Spirits.

### Firemoss

Firemoss is a colorful orange moss found hanging from shade trees in and
around Dolmvay. A clump of firemoss burns with the light and duration of
a torch. A specially designed bronze rod with an enclosed brazier on top
known as a firemoss torch costs 5 gp. A large belt pouch holding six
clumps of firemoss may be purchased for 1 gp, making firemoss a much
less cumbersome than carrying bundles of torches.

### Hilt Blossoms

This red flowering plant contains four petals in a shape that resembles
the Holy Hilt. The flower is grown in gardens all over Dolmvay. Any
cleric character who wears a wreath of fresh hilt blossoms receives a +1
to all Charisma checks.

### Meschil Root

The orange root of this unassuming green plant is used in many herbal
remedies for headaches and stress. When brewed in a tea, it provides a
+1 bonus to saving throws vs. mind-affecting spells such as *charm
person* for a duration of 1d6 turns. The root is associated with St.
Meschil, and is used by her devotees to help treat the &quot;Visionarres&quot;.

### Sewer Mushrooms

Sewer mushrooms are addictive brown mushrooms that grow in dank,
lightless places on piles of human waste. When dried and eaten, the
mushrooms produce mild hallucinations and increased sexual drive. Most
of these hallucinations are pleasant, but on rare occasions (about 5% of
the time), the hallucinations cause the eater to become enraged and
attack everything in sight for 1d6 turns before falling unconscious for
eight hours.

### Sewerscum

Sewerscum is a an accumulation of sludge, offal, and human waste
streaked with veins of a toxic blue fungus. Sewerscum acts as a cheap
poison that can be used to coat edged weapons. Anyone struck by a
sewerscum-coated blade must make a saving throw vs. poison or fall
violently ill for 1d4 days. During this time, the character must remain
bedridden and is unable to act. At the end of this time, the character
must make a second saving throw vs. poison or die. In Dolmvay, coating
one&#39;s weapons with sewerscum carries a charge of armed assault, even if
the weapon is not used in an attack.

### Sweet Lotus

Sweet lotus is a pink flowering plant whose petals taste like ripe
berries. Sweet lotus must be specially cultivated and is usually found
only in private gardens in the North Ward. It is a mild stimulant and
breath freshener that is chewed mainly by nobles and wealthy merchants.

### Reddarklon

This black lichen is streaked with red veins. It grows only in damp,
lightless places beneath the earth. When the lichen coats walls, it
doubles the normal range of infravision.

## NEW MONSTERS

&gt; &quot;I&#39;ve seen a gronted child before. A foul creature living in the
&gt; runoff waste of an old tannery guildworks. A pox upon her parents for
&gt; not drowning her at birth.&quot;  
&gt; —Aron the Beltmaker

The following new monsters may be found in and around the City of
Dolmvay.

### ALLIGATOR
No. Enc.: 0 (1d8)

***Hold Breath***. The alligator can hold its breath for 15 minutes.  
#### Actions
______________________________________
***Bite***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the alligator can&#39;t bite another target.

Alligators are aggressive reptiles, with fearsome bites that are known
to prowl the sewers of Dolmvay. They breathe air, but are aquatic and
usually remain submerged or within shallow water. They primarily hunt in
water, and are attracted by movement or blood. Large alligators, on
average, grow to a length of 12’. Alligators have the ability to remain
motionless and blend into their environment, gaining surprise on a 1-3
on 1d6.

An alligator that rolls a natural 20 on its to-hit roll, clamps down and
begins a &quot;death roll&quot;, knocking its victim to the ground and delivering
an automatic 1d6 hit points of damage per round for the next 1d4 rounds.
Any person caught in a death roll must make a Str check at -2 to escape.
The alligator directs its death roll towards the nearest body of water,
forcing its victim to contend with drowning as well.


### ASHOGARR
No. Enc.: 1d4 (2d4)  
*Medium undead, neutral evil*  
______________________________________
**Armor Class** 8  
**Hit Points** 22 (3d8 + 9)  
**Speed** 120 ft. (40ft.)

**Condition Immunities** poisoned  
**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 8  
**Languages** understands the languages it knew in life but can&#39;t speak  
**Challenge** 1/4 (50 XP)  
______________________________________
***Undead Fortitude***. If damage reduces the Ashogarr to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the Ashogarr drops to 1 hit point instead.
#### Actions
______________________________________
***Slam***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage.  

Ashogarrs are undead creatures that appear as waterlogged zombies, often
covered with seaweed, barnacles, or rotting vegetation. Ashogarr are the
remains of drowning victims, particularly those killed by murder,
betrayal, or neglect. Ashogarr sightings are common along the coastal
regions, especially after a bad storm.

Ashogarrs possess cunning intelligence and are capable of solving simple
problems. They cannot swim, but can walk along the ocean floor at half
their normal movement rate. Tales of ashogarrs climbing anchor chains to
clamber over the sides of ships are common, especially among the pirates
of Jameston.

Anyone touched by an ashogarr must make a saving throw vs. spells.
Failure means the character&#39;s lungs begin to fill up with water, causing
a fit of choking that imposes a -2 penalty to-hit, a +2 penalty to AC,
and a -2 penalty to all ability checks. Any healing magic such as a
*cure light wounds* spell or a potion of healing negates these effects.

If no such magic is available, a saving throw vs. death is required
after 6 rounds. Failure means the character dies, only to rise again on
the following night as an ashogarr. Creatures that breathe water, as
well as anyone under the effects of a spell or magic item that conveys
water breathing are immune to this power.

Ashogarrs are immune to *sleep, charm,* and *hold* spells. When slain,
they dissolve into a puddle of watery sludge.


### CHALEK
No. Enc.: 1 (1d3)  
*Medium fey, neutral evil*  
______________________________________
**Armor Class** 17 (natural armor)  
**Hit Points** 82 (11d8 + 33)  
**Speed** 30 ft.  
______________________________________
| **STR** | **DEX** | **CON** | **INT** | **WIS** | **CHA** |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 18 (+4) | 12 (+1) | 16 (+3) | 13 (+1) | 14 (+2) | 14 (+2) |
______________________________________
**Skills** Arcana +3, Deception +4, Perception +4, Stealth +3  
**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14  
**Languages** Common, Draconic, Sylvan  
**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)  
______________________________________
***Amphibious***. The Chalek can breathe air and water.  
***Innate Spellcasting***. The Chalek&#39;s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  
At will: *dancing lights, minor illusion, vicious mockery*  
***Mimicry***. The Chalek can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.
#### Actions
______________________________________
***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

***Illusory Appearance***. The Chalek covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

Chalek are a race of creatures that resemble human men and women. They
are practitioners of the dark magical arts who serve powerful entities
such as evil deities, demons, or devils. Repeated contact with this
entity takes a toll on the chalek&#39;s physical form and they are often
hideous to behold. It is said that milk curdles, plants wither, and
animals come up lame in their presence.

Chalek can cast spells as a magic-user or cleric at a level equal to
their Hit Dice. They are capable of brewing magical potions and some can
even create magic items. These items are almost always cursed or
otherwise possess &quot;evil&quot; magical abilities that only serve to empower
the chalek&#39;s patron deity, such as a *long sword+1, life drinker*.

Once per week a chalek is capable of uttering a powerful curse on behalf
of another. Each curse involves a different ritual and requires some
sort of sacrifice. The ritual and the sacrifice usually involve
something of great personal value to the person requesting the curse.
Only the death of this person or some sort of holy quest (designed by
the DM) can remove this curse. (a *remove curse* spell is
ineffective). Chalek may also use their dying breath to utter a similar
curse on their own behalf.

Chalek tend to live in ramshackle dwellings, caves, or otherwise hidden
or secluded lairs. They take time to befriend the local populace by
posing as sages, midwives, or healers, just waiting for some jealous,
greedy, or vengeful person to seek them out.


### CHARAK
No. Enc.: 1 (1d2)  
*Large beast, unaligned*  
______________________________________
**Armor Class** 11  
**Hit Points** 52 (8d10 + 8)

**Languages** -  
**Challenge** 1 (200 XP)  
______________________________________

***Underwater Camouflage***. The Charak has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while underwater.  
***Water Breathing***. The Charak can breathe only underwater.
#### Actions
______________________________________
***Tentacles***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the Charak can&#39;t use its tentacles on another target.

***Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)***. A 20- foot radius cloud of ink extends all around the octopus if it is underwater. The area is heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a significant current can disperse the ink. After releasing the ink, the Charak can use the Dash action as a bonus action.

Charaks resemble giant amphibious octopi or squids that prefer large
pools of stagnant water in deep swamps, dark jungles, or dank
underground sewers. Charaks are aggressive and territorial hunters that
are capable of moving overland once they’ve exhausted their food supply.

Their 10’ long tentacles are studded with barbs and sharp-edged suckers.
These tentacles constrict victims when they successfully attack, and
deal 1d3 hit points of damage each per successive rounds. For each
tentacle that is constricting a victim, the victim suffers a cumulative
attack penalty of –1.

For example, if four tentacles are constricting a character, he suffers
–4 to hit. A tentacle can be cut off if a total of 6 hit points or more
of damage is dealt with one blow. If a charak is losing an encounter, it
retreats beneath the surface of its pool.

At least two charaks have been slain in the Dolmvay sewers and more are
believed to exist.


### DECEIVER
No. Enc.: 1
*Medium monstrosity (shapechanger), neutral*
______________________________________

______________________________________
**Skills** Deception +6, Insight +3  
**Condition Immunities** charmed  
**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11  
**Languages** Common  
**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)  
______________________________________
***Shapechanger***. The deceiver can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn&#39;t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.  
***Ambusher***. The deceiver has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.  
***Surprise Attack***. If the deceiver surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage from the attack.
#### Actions
______________________________________
***Multiattack***. The deceiver makes two melee attacks.  
***Slam***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.  

A deceiver is distantly related to other shapeshifting species such as
the mimic, cloaker, and lurker above. Deceivers were created by the
Order of Karth to sow chaos throughout the city.

The deceiver hunts by assuming the shape of a flat inanimate object such
as a wall, door, or cobblestone street. It then produces a pseudopod
that loosely imitates the shape of a living being, typically that of an
unconscious woman or an injured child. The deceiver then uses simple
sounds such as whistling or crying to lure its prey to their doom.

The deceiver has difficulty mimicking faces, so will always seek to
conceal the face of the mimicked creature. For example, a mimicked child
pseudopod may be facing a wall with its head buried in its arms, a
mimicked man pseudopod may appear to be stuck in a window, or a mimicked
woman pseudopod may be lying facedown in an alley.

Anyone who touches the deceiver&#39;s pseudopod is held in place with a
glue-like substance that requires a Strength check at -4 to break free.
The deceiver uses additional bludgeoning pseudopods to attack stuck
creatures, dealing 2d4 hit points damage per strike.

The deceiver retreats to its lair (usually an abandoned building or an
old section of sewer) to devour anyone it kills.


### DOVECROW
No. Enc.: 2d10 (10d20)  
*Small beast, unaligned*

#### Actions
______________________________________
***Talons***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage.

Dovecrows are white crow-like birds native to the coasts of the Duchy of
Valnwall. Dovecrows are fiercely territorial. They have no fear of
predators, and flocks of dovecrows have actually been known to drive off
falcons and hawks. Dovecrow meat is considered a delicacy, and a leisure
pursuit of the wealthy involves breeding dovecrows in rooftop coops.

According to legends, dovecrows were once used to carry messages back
and forth between the Great Cities, but this skill has been lost to
time. Dovecrows are associated with St. Valen of Vay and have been
adopted as a symbol of the Church of Law and Order.

A gargola is a malevolent, wraithlike creature that is capable of
inhabiting and animating statues in order to attack and devour the
citizens of Dolmvay. A gargola is invisible in its natural form. If seen
through magic such as a *detect invisible* spell, gargolas resemble a
cloud of mist.

Gargolas have no attacks in their natural form. When inhabiting a
statue, the gargola attacks with the statue&#39;s natural weapons (claws,
bite, sword, etc.) for 1d8 hit points of damage. The statue has 4 HD, is
AC 2, and has a movement rate of 90&#39; (30&#39;). The statue may possess other
attacks, movement rates, or abilities (such as flight), depending on the
nature of the inhabited statue, at the DM&#39;s discretion.

Gargolas are immune to *sleep, charm,* and *hold* spells. In their
natural form, they are immune to normal weapons. The inhabited statue,
however, may be struck by normal weapons. If the statue is destroyed,
the gargola follows its attackers invisibly, randomly inhabiting statues
and attacking loved ones over the course of the next few weeks. If the
gargola is injured while in its natural form, it retreats from the area
as quickly as possible.

Gargolas were created long ago by wizards of the Order of Karth in order
to sow fear and chaos throughout the city. They typically lie dormant,
hovering in the sewers, dungeons, or other ancient structures of
Dolmvay, awakening only on prearranged dates, times, and stellar
configurations. Dormant gargolas may be detected by people passing
through them as areas of extreme cold.

A confirmed gargola attack has not been experienced in over a decade,
and the Church of Law and Order (wrongly) maintains they are but a
distant memory of Dolmvay&#39;s past.


### GRONTED ANIMAL
No. Enc.: as animal x (1/2)  
**Alignment:** Neutral  
**Movement:** as animal  
**Armor Class:** as animal (-1)  
**Hit Dice:** as animal (+1 hp)  
**Attacks:** as animal  
**XP:** varies  

Animals in the Dolmvay area are sometimes born with physical and
behavioral deformities that manifest as bulbous heads, large bloodshot
eyes, wide mouths full of misshapen teeth, and violent and aggressive
tendencies. Gronted animals are nocturnal creatures with painfully short
lifespans. They are voracious eaters that spend most of their time
hunting and devouring prey. Gronted animals are considered abominations
that are killed on sight.

The meat of a gronted animal is toxic—anyone who feeds on a gronted
animal must make a saving throw vs. poison or become violently ill for
2d4 days. During this time, the person is bedridden and unable to take
action. At the end of this time, the person must make a saving throw vs.
death or die from the sickness. A *neutralize poison* spell cures the
sickness.

The cause of the gront deformities is unknown and has been attributed to
everything from evil magic to demonic impregnation. Gronted animals are
most commonly found in and around the Guild District, leaving some
scholars to believe the gront deformities may simply be caused by
pollution.

A pack of gronted hounds can terrorize a neighborhood, attacking adults
in broad daylight and carrying children off into the night. If six or
more gronted hounds are encountered, one of the hounds will be a pack
leader with 2 HD whose bite does 1d6+1 hit points of damage.

Packs of gronted rats are often found in guildworks cellars and Dolmvay
sewers. Like normal rats, gronted rats are disease carriers. Any
character bitten by a gronted rat has a 5% chance of contracting a
disease. The bitten character must make a saving throw vs. poison or die
in 1d6 days. A successful saving throw leaves the character sick and
bedridden for 30 days, after which time there is a 25% chance the
disease proves fatal. The spell *cure disease* removes this infection.
Gronted rats may be warded away with fire. They are adept swimmers who
are at home in Dolmvay&#39;s sewers.

A Gronted Fish is a carnivorous fish with sharp teeth. Gronted Fish can adapt to any aquatic environment, including cold subterranean lakes. They frequently gather in swarms; the statistics for a swarm of Gronted Fish appear later in this appendix.

Schools of gronted fish sometimes prowl the dark reaches of Dolmvay&#39;s
canals and sewers. When prey enters the water, the school attacks en
masse, engulfing its victim in a 10&#39; x 30&#39; cloud of darting, biting
fish. A school does not need to roll to-hit, and inflicts 1d3 hit points
of damage to anyone engulfed. Blood in the water sends the school into a
frenzy, giving it an additional +1 damage.

***Amphibious***. The Loskath can breathe air and water.  
##### Actions
______________________________________
***Bite***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +0 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1 piercing damage.

Loskath resemble wormlike maggots that lie dormant in old wells,
stagnant ponds, and other still pools of water. Their rubbery skin is
translucent, making them difficult to detect and enabling them to
achieve surprise on a 1-5 on 1d6. Loskath are drawn to heat (such as
someone stopping to fill a canteen or wash in the pool). There is a 5%
chance that anyone drinking the water swallows one or more loskath.

Upon contact with a living being, loskath begin to vigorously burrow
deep into the body. If not stopped immediately with an application of
holy water, the loskath burrow into the victim&#39;s stomach within 1d4
turns. Once in the stomach, the loskath ignites itself, burning the
victim from within and causing 1d6 hit points of fire damage per round.
This damage is incurable by normal means. Unless healed by magic such as
a *cure light wounds* spell, the victim becomes bedridden and dies
within a day, even if the flames are extinguished. If the fire is not
extinguished, 2d4 new loskath crawl from the victim&#39;s ashes and wriggle
their way towards the nearest body of water.

Loskath are destroyed by drinking holy water or pouring it into an open
wound. One vial of holy water used in this manner kills 1d6 loskath (and
extinguishes any internal flames). A *cure disease* spell destroys all
loskath in the victim&#39;s body.

The loskath were created by the Order of Pagonnus—a powerful Druunic
sect led by the high priest Kaleb Pagonnus. The loskath were considered
sacred creatures by the Druun and were bred mainly for a sacrificial
ritual known as the &quot;Wooden Man&quot;.

Ruks are foul-smelling humanoids with black hair, bestial faces, and
reddish eyes. An adult male ruk stands about 6 feet tall and females are
slightly smaller. Ruks dwell anywhere in the wilderness, above or below
ground. They are nocturnal creatures who suffer a penalty of –1 to-hit
when in sunlight.

Ruks are exceedingly cruel and delight in the torment of others. They
are exceptionally greedy and love to kill, which makes them particularly
attractive to chaotic rulers who hire them as mercenary soldiers and
bodyguards.

Ruks carry shields and wear whatever pieces of armor they can scrounge.
Common weapons include axes, heavy spears, and crudely forged long
swords. Throwing spears and short bows are preferred for ranged combat.
Ruks prefer vivid colors that most humans would consider unpleasant,
such as blood red, mustard yellow, yellow-green, and deep purple. Their
equipment is usually rusted and dirty.

Ruk raiders prefer to prey upon small farms, settlements, and caravans,
attacking with surprise or from ambush whenever possible. Raiding
parties number anywhere from three ruks up to two dozen, although bigger
bands have been known to attack larger settlements. When traveling
through the wild they tend to spread out in groups of two or three, with
the rest close by, so adventurers should be wary.

When speed is needed to hunt down prey or outrun pursuit, a strong ruk
leader can harangue his band into two or three ragged columns. This
leader has 8 hit points, receives a +1 bonus to damage because of his
exceptional strength, and possesses an XP value of 16. Should the leader
of a party of ruks be slain, the remaining ruks have a morale of 6.

Ruks are socially organized around warring tribes, which have violent
names like the “Death’s Head” tribe or the “Warmonger” tribe. Tribes
seldom work together unless united under a strong (and fear-inducing)
leadership. Any tribe has roughly an equal number of males and females,
with as many children as there are adults. The ruk tribal chief fights
as a monster with 4 HD, has 15 hit points, and an XP value of 25. He
will be very strong, having a bonus of +2 to damage. There is a 60%
chance that any tribe consisting of 20 or more ruks will also have an
ogruk present.

Ruks worship a pantheon of foul gods led by a war god named Groms.

**Note:** Goblins, orcs, and hobgoblins do not exist on Amherth. The
DM should feel free to substitute ruks for orcs. A smaller,
weaker breed of ruks (HD 1-1) known as gobruks may be used in place of
goblins. A larger, stronger breed of ruks (HD 1+1) known as ubruks may
be substituted for hobgoblins. These variant species otherwise conform
to the ruk entry, above. The goblinoid races as a whole are known as
*rukha*.

### SERPHALA

Armor Class: 7

Hit Dice: 2

Attacks: None

Damage:

Hoard Class: None

XP: 38

Serphala are a pacifistic race of human/bird hybrids. They are descended
from harpies that were selectively trained and bred by the Church of Law
and Order for their beauty and docility. Less than one hundred serphala
are believed to exist.

The song of the serphala is a haunting melody that conveys effects
similar to a *bless* spell to all those who hear it. Once per day, a
serphala can also sing a song that produces an effect similar to a
*charm person* spell. A successful saving throw grants the character
immunity to the serphala&#39;s song for the remainder of the encounter.

A serphala&#39;s feathers range in color from white to tan, and they
typically wear flowing white robes and gold jewelry. The serphala dwell
in small coveys in the Holy Aerie where they are tended by Valenon
clergymen. They are considered sacred creatures who are kept isolated
from others to ensure they remain pure.

The serphala possess human-level intelligence, however, the church
treats them as intelligent animals and does not teach them how to speak.
On holy days, the serphala have been trained to fly to specially
designed perches around St. Poul&#39;s Square and treat the masses to their
enchanted song. The song of the serphala can also sometimes be heard
entertaining the High Lawlord and his most distinguished guests.

### SEWER SLIME

XP: 29

Sewer slime is a semi-intelligent green slime that prowls the dankest
portions of the Dolmvay sewers. Sewer slime feeds on plants, animals,
and metals, including weapons and armor, but cannot digest stone.

Sewer slime senses movement through subtle vibrations. It attacks by
dropping from high places onto victims or clinging to an opponent who
steps on it. Once in contact with a victim, sewer slime digests all
clothing and armor in 6 rounds. The slime feeds so quickly that after
this period, in only 4 rounds after contacting an animal&#39;s (or
character&#39;s!) bare skin, the slime completely digests it, creating more
slime in its place. No magical revival is possible for a victim as
nothing material of the victim remains.

Sewer slime is immune to normal weapons as well as electricity- and
cold-based attacks, but is susceptible to fire. The slime clings in such
a way to make scraping it off ineffective. Note that if sewer slime is
burned while it is on a character, the damage from the fire is divided
evenly between the slime and the character. Sewer slime is killed
instantly by a *cure disease* spell.

A **bull shark** is 30 feet long and normally found in deep oceans. Utterly fearless, it preys on anything that crosses its path, including whales and ships.

A bull shark is an aggressive species of shark that can live in both
freshwater and saltwater. A bull shark has a thick body and blunted
nose. It grows up to eight feet long and weighs approximately three
hundred pounds. When on the hunt, bull sharks glide silently through the
water and are capable of surprising prey in water on a roll of 1-3 on
1d6. Bull sharks are common in King&#39;s Bay and at the mouth of the Dolm
River, and are sometimes found swimming in the Dolmvay sewers.

***Web Sense***. While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.  
***Web Walker***. The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.
#### Actions
______________________________________
***Bite***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.  
***Web (Recharge 5-6)***. *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).

To snare its prey, a **glass spider** spins elaborate webs or shoots sticky strands of webbing from its abdomen. Glass spiders are most commonly found underground, making their lairs on ceilings or in dark, web-filled crevices. Such lairs are often festooned with web cocoons holding past victims

A glass spider is an enchanted, web-spinning spider that is made of
glass. A glass spider conceals itself by magically merging with large
glass objects (such as windows, chandeliers, piles of broken glass,
etc.) to lie in wait for prey. Glass spiders often meld with stained
glass windows to better hide their outline. A glass spider surprises its
opponents on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 when merged with clear glass, or 1-5
on 1d6 when merged with stained glass.

A glass spider attacks from ambush by launching net-like webs made of
clear, sticky strands interlaced with razor-sharp bits of glass. Anyone
struck by a net becomes ensnared. Ensnared victims suffer penalties of
-30&#39; (-10&#39;) to movement rate, +2 to AC, -2 to-hit, and -2 to all ability
checks per net. The victim must make a Strength check to break free, but
suffers 1d8 hit points of damage per round for each net (chain mail
armor or better reduces this damage to 1d4 hit points per round).

A character whose movement rate is reduced to 0&#39; is considered cocooned
and is unable to take action as the glass spider feeds. Once the victim
is drained of all fluids, the victim&#39;s skin and bones magically turn to
brittle glass.

If cornered, a glass spider attacks with its bite. Anyone bitten by a
glass spider must make a saving throw vs. poison or be paralyzed.
Paralyzed characters are cocooned and drained, as above.

Glass spiders are drawn to lavish buildings such as palaces, mansions,
and cathedrals. They were created long ago by wizards of the Order of
Karth to generate fear in the hearts and minds of the faithful.

# ISLE OF HEROES

&gt; &quot;Guild membership gives us rights. It instills purpose and a sense of
&gt; responsibility. Before the Guild, adventurers were looked upon as
&gt; homeless vagabonds who would happily murder and rob you for your
&gt; wealth. We are heroes now, and we must act accordingly.&quot;  
&gt; —Headmaster Mikael of Patton

## Dolmvay Adventurer&#39;s Guild
The Dolmvay Adventurer&#39;s Guild is located on the Isle of Heroes. All
Lawful and Neutral adventurers are required to join the guild. The guild
provides a number of services to its members including training
facilities, free access to local libraries and museums, and basic
barracks-type food and lodging for members too poor to afford better
accommodations. Temporary lodging for named adventuring companies is
also available for an additional fee.

The guild acts as an intermediary that can broker the sale of expensive
goods for fair market value. It provides law counsel to members accused
of crimes. Most importantly, members in good standing can expect a
steady supply of prospective employers.

### Standard
The Dolmvay Adventurer&#39;s Guild standard is a crossed long sword and
short sword superimposed on a holy hilt, surrounded by a ring of arcane
symbols. The images are representative of the various classes—long sword
for fighters, short sword for thieves, holy hilt for clerics, and arcane
symbols for magic-users.

### Guild Dues
The cost to join the Adventurer&#39;s Guild is 1 gp, and dues are equal to
10% of any wealth recovered. New members are logged into the guild
record books and given a stamped metal chit to be worn on the neck,
ankle, or wrist. The chit contains special runes that indicate its place
of origin and also act as a personal identification number that allows
the guild to track the member&#39;s activities throughout the free kingdoms
of Amherth.

Law-abiding merchants must log the runes before buying any goods from
the adventurers. This log is then submitted to the guild Treasurer.
Guild members who fail to log their runes or non-guild members caught in
the act of selling goods pillaged from the surrounding countryside may
be arrested for guild evasion.

### Guild Hierarchy
The Adventurer&#39;s Guild contains a hierarchy, just like any other guild.
his hierarchy consists of apprentice, journeyman, and master guildsmen.

Guild members of 0-level are considered apprentice adventurers. These
apprentices are expected to accompany established adventuring companies.
While on adventures, apprentices perform menial tasks (cooking,
cleaning, tending horses, etc.), carry torches and gear, and train in
their desired class. Typical rates for these services are 1 sp per week,
plus food and shelter for the duration of the adventure.

In rare cases, 0-level apprentices may band together to undertake an
adventure on their own. These adventures are considered &quot;unlicensed&quot; by
the guild and, more often than not, tend to result in the death of
numerous apprentices. The Adventurer&#39;s Guild imposes a 50% tax on all
wealth recovered by apprentice adventurers instead of the normal 10%.

Upon attaining 1st level (in any class), the apprentice guild member may
pay 1 gp to be accepted as a journeyman adventurer. He is now allowed to
hire apprentices, undertake his own adventures, join an existing
adventuring company, or even start one of his own.

Guild members who achieve 4th level or higher are considered master
adventurers. Masters are given a guild signet ring (worth 150 gp) in a
special ceremony. This ring contains the same runic markings as the
identification chit.

**Note:** The 4th level master adventurer requirement reflects the
low-level default of the *Chronicles of Amherth™* campaign setting. The
DM may increase this level requirement to suit his or her
own game, as needed.

### Training Facilities
The guild provides facilities for all sorts of training. Fighters can
practice jousting, melee, or archery on the greens. Magic-users may pore
over old tomes in the guild library, learn new spells, or conduct
magical research in the guild laboratory. Thieves are given doors and
chests to unlock and traps to find and disarm. Clerics are free to
discuss the faith, read religious texts, and pray at the Chapel of St.
Aleena.

### Guild Treasury
The guild Treasurer is responsible for collecting 10% of the value of
recovered wealth for guild dues. The Treasurer expects adventurers to
settle these dues at the end of each month. The Treasurer can appraise
valuable items for free. The Treasurer can also broker the sale of
treasure, upon an adventurer&#39;s request. This means that adventurers
seldom have to haggle with merchants over the price of goods. (the
Treasurer automatically deducts 10% of the value for dues when brokering
such deals.) Wealth may also be stored in the Guild Treasury at a flat
rate of 10% of the value.

### Curative Magic
The Lawmaster of the Adventurer&#39;s Guild is authorized to bestow *cure wounds* blessings on adventurers as needed. Other types of blessings
(*cure disease*, *neutralize poison*, *raise dead*, etc.) must adhere to the church&#39;s guidelines.

### Wizardly Magic
The Isle of Heroes is one of the few places in Dolmvay where magic is
truly accepted. Guild magic-users and elves may use the guild library
and laboratory for research, but must notify the Spellmaster before
conducting major summonings or experiments. The Spellmaster can cast
*detect magic* on any object for free. An *identify* spell can be cast
at the cost of 1,000 gp, with the results to be determined normally. The
Spellmaster is always interested in trading for new books, spells, or
spellbooks.

### Guild Records
Adventurers are expected to log their exploits with the Recordsmaster to
be placed in the guild record books. These records are then submitted to
the City Crier&#39;s Guild. Over the course of the next few days, criers go
out into the city to spread word of the party&#39;s deeds. The most famous
deeds are often translated into epic stories, poems, and songs to
entertain the citizens of Dolmvay.

In this manner, the most heroic adventurers achieve celebrity status and
gain the popular support of the people. The guild imposes severe fines
and other penalties on adventurers who are caught lying about their
adventures. Adventurers who refuse to record their exploits are
considered no better than homeless bands of trespassers, thieves, grave
robbers, and even murderers, who may be subject to prosecution by the
law.

### Mutual Aid

The King&#39;s Army, King&#39;s Navy, the Church of Law and Order, and all
branches of the City Watch have an informal mutual aid agreement with
the Dolmvay Adventurer&#39;s Guild. Adventurers are expected to assist these
organizations upon request. In times of great trouble (such as an
impending conflict or war, especially where magic is involved),
adventurers are expected to report to the Isle of Heroes in order to
help organize the city&#39;s defenses.

### Adventurer&#39;s Challenge

The Dolmvay Adventurer&#39;s Guild holds an annual tournament known as the
Adventurer&#39;s Challenge, where different adventuring companies select
champions to compete against each another in a series of games, mock
battles, and class-oriented tests of strength and skill.

The Adventurer&#39;s Challenge was once held on the Isle of Heroes during
the Festival of St. Aleena. However, the guild finally
bowed to popular demand and the tournament was relocated to the Dolmvay
Coliseum. The guild still occasionally conducts its own Adventurer&#39;s
Challenge tournaments in the dungeons located beneath the Hall of
Heroes.

### Adventurer&#39;s Grind

Adventuring companies may pay a fee of 1,000 gp per character level each
to undertake an Adventurer&#39;s Grind. The Grind is an adventure in a fully
stocked wilderness or dungeon environment. Wilderness grinds take place
on the Isle of Heroes. Dungeon grinds take place in the Dungeon of
Heroes and may or may not involve combat against monsters in the Arena
of Champions. These grinds are stocked and managed by guild masters on
site.

Adventurer&#39;s Grinds are a great way for adventurers to face hazards,
overcome obstacles, and train tactics in a somewhat controlled
environment. The dangers of an Adventurer&#39;s Grind are very real. The
monsters tend to be aggressive and make full use of features and
terrain. The guild accepts no responsibility for adventurers injured or
killed during an Adventurer&#39;s Grind.

### Dungeon Stocking

The Adventurer&#39;s Guild purchases aggressive animals (bears, lions, etc.)
as well as monsters (rust monsters, owl bears, oozes, etc.) for use in
training. The guild prefers young creatures that are easier to control,
but may purchase fully grown creatures when preparing for a competition
or event such as an Adventurer&#39;s Grind. Captured humanoids such as ruks,
ogruks, trolluks, etc. sometimes volunteer to fight in the arena or
dungeons to avoid being slaughtered in their own lairs by powerful
adventuring companies or shipped off to toil away in ducal labor camps.

The guild typically pays 1 gp per experience point (XP) value of an
adult specimen (even if the creature is not an adult). Unless special
arrangements are made beforehand, the guild does not accept fully grown
monsters with greater than six Hit Dice (HD). The guild is not liable
for any mishaps that occur when transporting monsters to the Isle of
Heroes for sale.

## ISLE OF HEROES
&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll be happy to buy those young giant scorpions from you. I&#39;m sure
&gt; we can find a use for them once they&#39;ve grown.&quot;  
&gt; —Delvemaster Drager Broaden

The headquarters of the Dolmvay Adventurer&#39;s Guild is located on a small
island in the Dolm River named the Isle of Heroes. This private island
is used for guild training, research, and accommodations for guild
members who prefer to dwell among other adventurers. The citizens of
Dolmvay have grown accustomed to strange sounds, flashes of light, and
even the roar of terrible beasts emanating from the island. According to
a royal charter drafted years ago, only guild members, clergymen, and
members of the royal family are allowed to visit the island uninvited.

# APPENDIX III: SEWERS OF DOLMVAY

&gt; &quot;It takes a special kind of person to enter the sewers of Dolmvay day
&gt; after day, night after night. You&#39;ve got to be tough, hardy, and above
&gt; all else, smart enough to know when to run. There are things down
&gt; there that will eat you for breakfast, spit out the pieces, and then
&gt; eat those pieces for lunch. This is your last chance to change your
&gt; minds.&quot;  
&gt; —recruitment speech given by Master Sewerman Kennon Upton

The sewers of Dolmvay are a mixture of natural caves, lead pipes,
twisting tunnels, and connecting chambers powered by ancient magic. The
walls are made of bricks, cut stone, and other more bizarre materials.
Water is supplied by aqueducts and several small underground streams.
Sewer tunnels tend to be curved to allow water to flow freely.

When blockages occur, the sewer magically slides walls, raises or lower
pipes, and flushes chambers in order to reroute water flow. This means
no trip into the sewers need ever be the same, making it easy for
DM&#39;s to insert their latest dungeon adventures.

The sewers eventually empty into a giant whirlpool named the Carylla
Vortex, which lies deep beneath the Dolm River.

**Note:** If the *Chronicles of Amherth™* campaign setting is being
used, the Sewers of Dolmvay are considered a minor lailon and are home
to several warmachten.

#### Public Perception
To the people of Dolmvay, the sewers are a dark and dangerous place
where only the foolhardy dare venture. The average citizen has no idea
to what depth the sewers extend or what sort of magic floods their
ancient passages. What&#39;s more, they don&#39;t *want* to know. What matters
to them is that the sewers work. They provide clean water and take away
waste. That is all the average citizen of Dolmvay is concerned about.

#### Sewer Maintenance
The Waterman&#39;s Guild is responsible for maintaining the flow of clean
water throughout the city. The Streetsweeper&#39;s Guild is responsible for
removing trash and debris from the Street Level. The Sewerman&#39;s Guild is
responsible for maintaining the city&#39;s sewers, but they rarely venture
deeper than the Upper Levels without an escort of adventurers because of
the dangers involved.

#### Clean Water Flow
Aqueducts, canals, and culverts control the flow of clean water
throughout the City of Dolmvay. This water is routed to bathhouses,
fountains, wells, wealthy manor homes, castles, and other important
buildings before making its way to the Dolmvay sewers. This running
water typically supplies only the first floor of these structures.

## SEWER LAYOUT
The Dolmvay sewer system consists of a Street Level, the Upper Levels,
the Middle Levels, and the Lower Levels. These levels are defined by
numerous features that are described here using a &quot;toolkit&quot; approach.
The DM is free to drop in premade sewer tunnels or take
these features and design new sections of the Dolmvay sewers as needed.
Sample sewer maps are also provided for easy use.

### STREET LEVEL
The Street Level of the Dolmvay sewer system removes solid waste from
the streets and helps keeps streets from flooding during heavy rains.
Common features include garderobes, street gutters, side grates, storm
grates, and grate shafts.

#### Garderobe
A garderobe is a small closet with a 1&#39; diameter hole in the floor. The
hole is actually a shaft that empties into a communal waste chamber in
the city&#39;s sewer system. Almost all older buildings and many of the
newer buildings have at least one garderobe. Other dwellings make use of
chamber pots which must be dumped down the nearest storm grate. Anyone
caught emptying a chamber pot into the street can be charged with
disturbing the peace.

#### Street Gutter
Shallow gutters line one or both sides of most city streets, side
streets, and alleys. These gutters empty into side grates or storm
grates, carrying excess water and trash into the sewers.

#### Side Grates
Side grates are small 1&#39; long rectangular wooden grates found along
street gutters that help divert excess water into mainlines.

#### Storm Grate
A storm grate is a wooden grate with small openings designed to block
large pieces of trash and debris from entering the sewers. A storm grate
is located in the center of streets, side streets, and alleys, usually
at intersections. The grates may be removed to allow direct access to
the Upper Levels of the sewers or access to a grate shaft. Storm Grates
are the main points of entry for members of the Sewerman&#39;s Guild.

#### Grate Shaft
Some storm grates open onto grate shafts, which are vertical tunnels
that empty into mainlines. Ladder rungs bolted to the walls of the shaft
help aid in descent.

### UPPER LEVELS
The Upper Levels of the sewer lie beneath the streets and dwellings of
Dolmvay. Common features include mainlines, sidelines, flow pipes, waste
chambers, sluice gates, drain grates, and junction chambers. These
features are often stacked on top of each other, creating a web-like
network of crisscrossing lines, pipes, and chambers.

Common underground chambers (larders, basements, etc.) as well as more
exotic underground chambers (laboratories, shrines, dungeons, etc.) may
be found in the Upper Levels, many of which can only be accessed by
hidden side tunnels. A number of natural caves, cave complexes, and
underground streams are also scattered throughout the Upper Levels of
Dolmvay&#39;s sewer system.

#### Mainlines
Sewer mainlines run parallel to most streets and can be accessed via
storm grates. Sewer mainlines consist of tunnels measuring about 10&#39;
wide. A steady stream of water runs about 3&#39; deep through a mainline. A
2&#39; to 3&#39; wide maintenance ledge located just above the water level
extends along one or both sides of the mainline. A mainline&#39;s arched
ceiling may be dotted by side grates, sidelines, grate shafts, and/or
drain shafts. Lead flow pipes are bolted to a mainline&#39;s walls.

#### Sideline
A sideline is a 3&#39; diameter tunnel that connects a waste chamber to a
mainline or junction chamber.

#### Flow Pipe
A flow pipe is a 1&#39; diameter lead pipe that carries running water from
fountains, bathhouses, and private dwellings into the sewers. Flow pipes
empty into mainlines, sidelines, waste chambers, and junction chambers.

#### Waste Chamber
A waste chamber is a large cistern that collects solid waste from nearby
garderobes. The typical waste chamber measures 10&#39; long by 10&#39; wide by
10&#39; high, but larger waste chambers are known to exist. When the waste
in the chamber reaches a certain level, the sewer magically opens sluice
gates and reroutes water to flush the waste into a sideline.

#### Sluice Gates
Sluice gates controls the water levels throughout the sewer. The sluice
gate system automatically opens and closes to remove routine blockages
(such as those found in waste chambers), but has been known to
malfunction. The sewer magically realigns its walls, tunnels, and
chambers to remove major (non-routine) blockages such as those caused by
heavy floods, discarded corpses, or collapsed tunnels.

#### Staircase Waterfall
A staircase waterfall is a stepped section of a mainline that serves to
slow the flow of water. Some staircase waterfalls are equipped with
sluice gates.

#### Junction Chamber
A junction chamber is a large square or octagonal manmade cistern
located at the intersection of several mainlines, sidelines, and flow
pipes. The typical junction chamber measures 30&#39; long by 30&#39; wide by 20&#39;
high.

#### Caves
A number of natural caves and cave complexes are located throughout the
sewers. Sewer caves may be dry, contain pools of stagnant water, or be
crisscrossed by natural streams. These caves may or may not be
inhabited. The DM should feel free to insert traps,
monsters, and cave adventures as needed.

#### Underground Streams

At least three underground streams feed the sewers of Dolmvay. These are
the Northbrook which lies beneath the North Ward, the Stream of Scholars
which lies beneath the District of Scholars, and the Southbrook which
lies beneath the South Ward. These streams contain features such as
waterfalls, rapids, and dams as they meander beneath the city. The
streams are sometimes navigated by those familiar with their routes.

#### Drain Gate
Drain gates are large metal or stone gates that magically open and close
to drain water into the Middle Levels. Drain gates are usually located
in the floor of junction chambers, but may be found anywhere, especially
after the sewer magically realigns. Anyone caught in the water when a
drain gate opens must make a saving throw vs. wands to avoid being swept
off their feet and sucked into the drain gate shaft.

#### Drain Gate Shaft
A drain gate shaft is a 3&#39; diameter tunnel that slopes from a drain gate
to the ceiling of a mainline in a lower portion of the Upper Levels or a
mainline in the Middle Levels.

#### Bridges
Bridges cross mainlines, streams, and some junction chambers. The older
bridges are made of stone while newer bridges are made of wood and rope.

#### Side Tunnels
Side tunnels are dry tunnels that connect the Dolmvay sewers to common
and exotic underground chambers (see below). Most side tunnels are
hidden by secret doors.

#### Common Underground Chambers
Common underground chambers include places such as wine cellars,
larders, and basements. These chambers are usually located beneath an
occupied building and are likely still in use. If a sewer entrance is
discovered, the building&#39;s owner may seal it with brick and mortar or
use it for his own (possibly illegal) purposes.

#### Exotic Underground Chambers
Exotic underground chambers include places such as libraries,
laboratories, tombs, shrines, temples, and dungeons. These chambers may
be currently in use or ancient and forgotten. The DM should
feel free to insert traps, monsters, and dungeon adventures as needed.

### MIDDLE LEVELS
The Middle Levels begin approximately 50&#39; beneath the city and contain
many of the same features as the Upper Levels. The Middle Levels also
house several underground lakes, rivers, and massive cisterns.

#### Great Cisterns
The Great Cisterns of Dolmvay&#39;s sewers lie deep beneath the city&#39;s
streets. A few of these cisterns are natural caves while others are
colossal, domed structures lined with ornate columns, alcoves, frescoes,
and bas-relief carvings. Some cisterns handle waste flow while others
are filled with fresh or brackish water. Freshwater cisterns often
connect to an occupied or unoccupied dungeon complex. Cisterns filled
with brackish water may provide undersea exits to King&#39;s Bay, at the
DM&#39;s discretion.

### LOWER LEVELS
The Lower Levels begin approximately 100&#39; beneath the city and contain
many of the same features as the Upper Levels and Middle Levels. The
Lower Levels also house several strange chambers including the vat
chambers, the lightning tower chambers, the machine chambers, and the
fabled Carylla Vortex. These chambers hold magical secrets of the
mythical race of beings known as the Ancients, who are said to have
nearly destroyed the world in one of the Great Cataclysms. The magic of
the Ancients is known to be powerful and unpredictable and is better
left alone.

**Note:** To maintain a sense of wonder when dealing with the magic of
the Ancients, whenever possible, the DM should attempt to
describe mechanical objects and devices in terms that the characters
(rather than the players) would understand.

#### Vat Chambers
Vat chambers are massive chambers lined with giant bronze vats connected
by strange assemblies of pipes, bins, shafts, conveyor belts, and
furnaces. These furnaces occasionally power to life for no apparent
reason, producing gouts of flame, sprays of scalding water, and enormous
amounts of heat. Once active, there is a 25% chance per turn the party
is exposed to one of the following sample effects. The DM is
free to design other effects, as needed.

#### Vat Chamber Effects
1.  **Dragon&#39;s Breath:** A spray of superheated water blasts the party for
    2d10 hit points damage (saving throw vs. breath weapon for 1/2).

2.  **Dragon&#39;s Fire:** A gout of flame erupts from a vent and scorches the
    party for 2d10 hit points of damage (saving throw vs. breath weapon
    for 1/2).

3.  **Purge:** An overflow pipe opens in the side of a massive vat, pouring
    water into the chamber. Each character must make a saving throw vs.
    wands to avoid being knocked off his feet, swept through an open
    drain shaft, and down into a Lower Level cistern.

4.  **Magic Rain:** The entire chamber is inundated with a cooling rain for
    2d4 turns. The water has a metallic taste and is extremely
    corrosive. Unless oiled within the next day, all non-magical metal
    items in the characters&#39; possession rust and become unusable.

5.  **Demon Smoke:** The entire chamber fills with smoke from several large
    furnaces, making it impossible to breathe. The smoke is vented out
    2d4 turns later.

6.  **Claw Attack:** The steel claw of some giant beast descends from the
    ceiling and attempts to grab one of the characters. The claw attacks
    for one round as a 5th level fighter and delivers 2d8 hit points of
    damage. Anyone struck by the claw is lifted into the air, carried
    across the chamber, and dropped onto a moving conveyor belt with
    several other items of metal scrap and debris. The belt is heading
    straight for a giant furnace located underneath one of the vats. If
    the character does not jump off the belt, he is carried into the
    furnace and consumed by flames.

#### Lightning Tower Chambers
These large chambers are filled with strange towers made of coiled
copper and bronze. The towers randomly come to life with blinking
colored lights and deadly arcs of lightning. Once active, there is a 25%
chance per turn the party is exposed to one of the following sample
effects. The DM is free to design other effects, as needed.

#### Lightning Chamber Effects
1.  **Lightning Strike:** Bolts of lightning arc off the tops of the towers,
    striking everyone in the room for 6d6 hit points of damage (saving
    throw vs. breath weapon for 1/2). As an added side effect, anyone
    carrying a wand, staff, rod, or other item that relies on charges
    finds the item fully recharged.

2.  **Flash of Light:** A series of lights blink brighter and brighter until
    the entire room is lit by a blinding flash. All characters must make
    a saving throw vs. spells or be blinded (as per the *blindness*
    spell) for 1d4 hours.

3.  **Lodestone:** As the lightning towers begin to vibrate, a series of
    large metal plates float by overhead. The plates are magnetically
    charged and are strong enough to attract any metal items the
    characters have in hand (shields, swords, etc.). Any character
    wearing metal armor is instantly slammed against the plate, taking
    2d6 hit points of damage. All metal items (and characters) are then
    dropped into a large cistern full of a strange liquid that dissolves
    metal on contact.

4.  **Magic Rain:** The entire chamber is inundated with a cooling rain for
    2d4 turns. The water has a metallic taste and is extremely
    corrosive. Unless oiled within the next day, all non-magical metal
    items in the characters&#39; possession rust and become unusable.

5.  **Vibration:** The lightning towers begin to vibrate until the chamber
    is filled with a deafening hum. All characters must make a saving
    throw vs. spells or be deafened (as per the *deafness* spell) for
    1d4 hours.

6.  **Reverse Gravity:** Lightning arcs across the towers, the towers begin
    to vibrate, and the entire chamber is affected by a loss of gravity
    (as per the *reverse gravity* spell). The effect lasts for 2d4
    turns.

#### Machine Chambers
Machine chambers are massive chambers filled with giant machines made of
bronze gears, open shafts, rotating wheels, spinning blades, and other
arcane constructs. A spiderweb of bronze catwalks stretch between the
great machines. The machines sometimes activate, producing frightful
clanking and grinding noises, but have no other apparent effect. Once
active, there is a 25% chance per turn the party is exposed to one of
the following sample effects. The DM is free to design other
effects, as needed.

#### Machine Chamber Effects
1.  **Magic Rain:** The entire chamber is inundated with a cooling rain for
    2d4 turns. The water has a metallic taste and is extremely
    corrosive. Unless oiled within the next day, all non-magical metal
    items in the characters&#39; possession rust and become unusable.

2.  **Arm Sweep:** The metallic arm of some giant beast sweeps across part
    of the chamber. Each character must make a saving throw vs. wands or
    be struck by the arm for 2d10 hit points of damage.

3.  **Shaft Opens:** A large metal shaft opens in the floor. Each character
    must make a saving throw vs. wands to avoid falling down the shaft
    and into a chamber full of piles of scrap metal (steel, iron,
    bronze, etc.), suffering 3d6 hit points of damage from the fall.

4.  **Spinning Blades:** A cluster of spinning blades whip through the
    chamber. Each character must make a saving throw vs. wands to avoid
    being struck by the blades for 3d6 hit points of damage.

5.  **Wind Tunnel:** The party is struck by a forceful gust of wind. Each
    character must make a saving throw vs. wands to avoid being sucked
    down a shaft and into a massive spinning blade, suffering 5d10 hit
    points of damage.

6.  **Grinding Gears:** The floor slides away, dropping the characters into
    a mass of grinding gears. Each character must make a saving throw
    vs. wands each round or be ground between two gears, suffering 5d10
    hit points of damage. The characters may make a Strength check each
    round in order to safely climb out of the gears and back into the
    chamber above.

#### Carylla Vortex (pr. ka-RILL-ah)
The Carylla Vortex is a vast underground whirlpool located in a massive
domed chamber deep beneath the Dolm River. All water and sewage
eventually ends up in the Carylla Vortex. Where it goes afterwards is a
mystery to all. . .

## STOCK ENCOUNTERS
The following stock encounters can be used when the characters begin
exploring Dolmvay&#39;s sewers. These encounters are loosely designed, so
the DM may have to spend an extra minute or so to decide how
the encounter begins.

1.  Alligator

2.  Drain Opens

3.  Flooded Chamber

4.  Gas Buildup

5.  Giant Rat

6.  Leaky Pipe

7.  Sewerman

8.  Shaft Opens

9.  Shark

10. Shifting Walls

11. Slick Floor

12. Waste Dump

#### Alligator
This encounter involves 1d8 alligators prowling the sewers. They may be
sunning themselves on a ledge, swimming though a mainline, or partially
submerged in a chamber. Alligators usually ignore characters unless
hungry or provoked. There is a 25% chance the alligator is a more
aggressive gront that attacks on sight.

**Alligator (1d8):** AL N; MV 60&#39; (20&#39;)/Swim 90&#39; (30&#39;); AC 14 (natural);
HD 2; \#AT 1; Dmg 1d6 (bite); SA surprise on a 1-3 on 1d6; SV F1; ML 7;
XP 20.

#### Drain Opens
A drain gate opens in the floor (50%) or ceiling (50%). Anyone caught in
the water when a drain gate opens in the floor must make a saving throw
vs. wands to avoid being sucked into the drain and dropped into a
mainline or chamber. There is a 25% chance that a drain gate that opens
in the ceiling drops a 1-2 (alligator), 3-4 (giant rat), or 5-6 (shark)
encounter into the area of the party. The animals are angry and attack
on sight.

#### Flooded Chamber
A sudden rush of water floods the chamber. Each character must make a
saving throw vs. wands to grab something sturdy and avoid being swept
away and suffering 2d6 hit points of damage before being dumped down a
drain gate.

#### Gas Buildup
A buildup of flammable gases in this area creates a fire hazard. Anyone
carrying an open flame ignites the gas, causing 5d6 hit points of damage
to everyone nearby (saving throw vs. breath weapon for 1/2 damage).

#### Giant Rat
This encounter involves 3d6 giant rats. They may be rummaging through
debris, returning to their lair, or on the hunt for prey. Giant rats
usually avoid contact with lights and loud noises, but may follow at a
distance to feed off leavings. There is a 25% chance the rats are more
aggressive gronts that attack on sight.

**Giant Rat (3d6):** AL N; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;)/Swim 60&#39; (20&#39;); AC 13 (natural);
HD 1d4 hit points; \#AT 1; Dmg 1d3 (bite) + special; SA 5% chance bite
causes disease; SV F1; ML 8; XP 6.

#### Leaky Pipe
A lead flow pipe running along the wall bursts, unleashing a powerful
blast of water. One character chosen at random must make a saving throw
vs. wands to avoid being knocked to the floor for 1d2 hit points damage
or knocked into the water (if water is present nearby). There is a 25%
chance that characters who fall in the water attract a 1-2 (alligator),
3-4 (giant rat), or 5-6 (shark) encounter. The sewers reroute the pipe&#39;s
water flow in 1d6 turns and a team of sewermen eventually arrive to
repair the pipe.

#### Sewerman
This encounter involves 2d4 sewermen from the Sewerman&#39;s Guild. They may
be clearing a blockage, mapping a recent change in the sewer&#39;s layout,
or repairing or replacing a burst pipe or broken grate. Sewermen are
almost always happy to see adventurers and can provide information about
the layout of the local sewers.

**Sewermen (2d4):** treat as 0-level humans with AC 12 (leather armor),
hp 3, sewer spear (Dmg 1d6), and dagger (Dmg 1d4). Sewermen never carry
valuables when on duty.

#### Shaft Opens
A shaft opens in the floor (50%) or ceiling (50%). When a shaft opens in
the floor, one character chosen at random must make a saving throw vs.
wands to avoid falling into the shaft and being dropped into a mainline
or chamber. There is a 25% chance that a shaft opening in the ceiling
drops a 1-2 (alligator), 3-4 (giant rat), or 5-6 (sewerman) encounter
into the area of the party. The animals are angry and attack on sight,
but the sewerman is likely thankful to see the party.

#### Shark
This encounter involves 1d6 bull sharks. The sharks are swimming in the
water, always on the hunt for prey. There is a 25% chance the sharks are
more aggressive gronts that attack on sight.

**Shark (1d6):** AL N; MV Swim 180&#39; (60&#39;); AC 16 (natural); HD 2; \#AT 1;
Dmg 2d4 (bite); SA surprise in water on 1-3 on 1d6; SV F1; ML 7; XP 20.

#### Shifting Walls
The walls, floors, lines, and water flow begin to shift. There is a 10%
chance the change happens so swiftly that each character must make a
saving throw vs. wands to avoid being cut off from the rest of the
party. Otherwise, there is more than enough time for the PCs to react.
Of course, any map the characters had of the area is no longer useful.

#### Slick Floor
The walls and floor here are particularly slick with mold and slime.
Each character must make a saving throw vs. wands to avoid slipping and
falling to the floor, suffering 1 hit point of damage or into the water
(if water is present nearby). There is a 25% chance that characters who
fall in the water attract a 1-2 (alligator), 3-4 (giant rat), or 5-6
(shark) encounter.

#### Waste Dump
A rush of raw sewage flows into the chamber from an overhead sideline as
a waste chamber empties. Each character must make a saving throw vs.
wands or be covered in foul-smelling human waste. The smell persists
even if the character immediately cleans himself up, inflicting a -2
penalty to all Reaction rolls for the next 24 hours.

## DETAILED ENCOUNTERS

#### Chaos Priest
The characters stumble upon a partially open secret door. The door opens
onto a side tunnel that leads to a shrine of the Church of Chaos and
Destruction. The walls of the 20&#39; x 20&#39; chamber are adorned with upside
down hilts and several sets of bloodstained manacles are bolted to the
floor. A small bloodstained altar occupies the center of the room. If
the characters linger in the chamber, a masked Chaos priest and two
acolytes enter, carrying an unconscious woman named Saral of Pike
Street.

Saral is a fisherman&#39;s daughter in the River District. She does not know
that her father is a Chaos devotee who drugged her and gave her to the
Chaos priest.

The priest and his acolytes attack on sight. The acolytes flee if the
priest is slain. The priest flees if the acolytes are slain or if he is
reduced to 2 hit points or less.

2, unarmed.

#### Drowned Deception
The characters see the body of a man lying on a ledge with his face
submerged in the water. The &quot;body&quot; is actually the pseudopod of a hungry
deceiver that attacks any who approach.

**Deceiver:** AL C; MV 30&#39; (10&#39;); AC 13 (natural); HD 5; hp 32 \#AT 1;
Dmg 2d4 (pseudopod) + special; SA sticky pseudopod requires a Strength
check at -4 to break free; SV MU5; ML 8; XP 500.

#### Guild Thief
A thief named Jasen Cotterly has located a secret side tunnel that leads
into the cellar of a nearby jeweler&#39;s shop. Jasen is waiting until
nightfall to break in. Jasen is a member of the Dolmvay Thieves&#39; Guild
and does not wish to draw attention to his activities. He attempts to
hide in shadows as the characters pass through this section of the
sewer. If that fails, Jasen pretends to have gotten lost while mapping
the city sewers. Jasen claims that this area of the sewers has changed
radically and he plans to sell his updated maps to the Sewerman&#39;s Guild.
If the characters discover the secret door, Jasen feigns surprise.

**Jasen Cotterly:** AL N; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 13 (leather armor + Dex); T3;

#### Hidden Cat
A gronted cat is hiding on a high ledge. The cat attacks the characters
as they pass by and fights for one round before fleeing. If the ledge
where the cat was hiding is examined, the characters discover a coughed
up hairball. If the hairball is broken apart, the characters find three
garnets (worth 25 gp each).

alligators that are sunning themselves on a dry ledge. The alligators
have just devoured a hapless broklaw gang member and are digesting the
meal. A gold earring (worth 15 gp) is caught between the teeth of the
largest alligator and the glint of gold can be seen in the sun. The
alligators attack if approached, but otherwise ignore the characters.

**Alligator (3):** AL N; MV 60&#39; (20&#39;)/Swim 90&#39; (30&#39;); AC 14 (natural); HD

characters do not leave immediately, they are attacked by 12 giant rats
who pour out of cracks in the walls and ceilings.

The characters pass through a particularly dark section of the sewers
that is home to hundreds of normal bats. The bats awaken and swarm the
characters if disturbed by torchlight or loud noises. Roll 1d6 to see
what the commotion attracts: 1-2 (2d4 giant rats), (3 broklaw gang
members), 5-6 (2 carcass scavengers).

15, 12, 11, 9, 9; \#AT 1; Dmg 2d4 (bite); SA surprise in water on 1-3 on

yellow garb exploring this portion of the sewers. The sewermen are
trying to find the source of a blocked drain. If the characters accompany the sewermen, they eventually
locate the source of the blockage—the bloated carcass of a large
triceratops. The DM is free to determine how and why the
dinosaur came to be here.

**Sewermen (5):** treat as 0-level humans with AC 12 (leather armor), hp
3, sewer spear (Dmg 1d6), and dagger (Dmg 1d4).

the sewer. The slime blends in with normal sewer scum, surprising on a
roll of 1-4 on 1d6. The slime attacks the feet and ankles of any who
walk by.

electricity- and cold-based attacks, immune to normal weapons; SV F1; ML

SV F3; ML 10; XP 82.

#### Dwarven Guardpost
The characters encounter a band of six armed dwarves who are shooting
dice near the entrance to a side tunnel. Their leader is a dwarf named Grimbel Spike-Helm. The dwarves
refuse to let the characters pass down the side tunnel. If asked, they
claim to be guarding the entrance to a merchant&#39;s cellar. If the
characters insist on passing, the dwarves attack. The tunnel they are
guarding may lead to a cellar, a dwarven shrine, or even an unexplored
labyrinth.

**Dwarf (6):** AL N; MV 90&#39; (30&#39;); AC 15 (chain mail); HD 1; hp 8, 7, 6,

#### Lurker
A lurker above is hovering close to the ceiling. It attacks the last
character who passes beneath it, surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6.
Characters who search the area nearby find the remains of the lurker&#39;s
last victim, a dwarf named Toren Anstaff. A search of the dwarf&#39;s
remains uncovers a *+1 dagger* (*+3 dagger* vs. elves) hidden in the bones.

**Lurker Above:** AL N; MV 10&#39; (3&#39;)/Fly 90&#39; (30&#39;); AC 14 (natural); HD

#### Rat Brothers
The characters encounter the brothers Bron and Thander Frost. The
brothers claim to be former sewermen who have decided to become
adventurers, but they are unable to produce any Adventurer&#39;s Guild
identification. Bron and Thander are actually wererats who live in the
Dolmvay sewers. They may attempt to join up with the party, only to
betray them later during a crucial moment.

**Bron and Thander Frost (wererat):** AL C; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 9 or 7
(natural); HD 3; hp 17, 15; \#AT 1; Dmg 1d6 (short sword) or 1d4 (bite);

sewers. It attacks anyone who enters the water or gets too close to the
water&#39;s edge.

F3; ML 8; XP 570.

#### Sewer Eels
Three 9&#39; long electric eels are gliding through the water in this
section of the sewer. The characters see faint pulses of light as they
pass by. The eels are hungry and attack anything that enters the water.
Electric eel carcasses may be sold to a magic-user for 1d6 x 50 gp.

**Electric Eel (3):** AL N; MV Swim 120&#39; (25&#39;); AC 11 (natural); HD 2; hp

#### Shrieking Shrooms
Eight shriekers are growing amidst the scum on the walls and ceiling.
They begin shrieking as soon as the party approaches. In the event of a
wandering monster, roll 1d6: 1-2 (ghoul pack), 3-4 (slithering tracker),
5-6 (morlock band).

**Shrieker (8):** AL N; MV 9&#39; (3&#39;); AC 13 (natural); HD 3; hp 20, 16 14,
10, 10, 9, 9, 5; \#AT 0; Dmg nil; SA 50% chance per round that shrieks
attract wandering monsters; SV F1; ML 12; XP 10.

#### Slithering Doom

until the party stops to rest for the night and then attacks one of the
characters in his sleep.

bodies of a sewerman and three broklaw thugs are cocooned in the

250 gp). The spider is hiding in a ceiling crevasse and attacks anything
that touches its web.

company such as the Tunnel Lords or another company of the Labyrinth
Lord&#39;s design.

**Tunnel Lords:** see [[District of Nobles]] for statistics.

#### Lightning Tower Chamber
The characters enter an active Lightning Tower Chamber. See above for
details.

#### Lost Ones
The characters encounter a band of feral humans wandering the Lower
Levels. These humans are the remnants of an adventuring company who
became lost in the sewer labyrinth years ago. The humans have devolved
to an animalistic state, wearing crude hides and carrying makeshift
weapons of bone and scraps of metal. The ferals may be interested in
trading shiny treasures for food, or they may attack outright.

**Feral Male (1d2):** treat as 0-level human with AC 12 (crude hides), hp
4, bone club (Dmg 1d4), sharpened metal (Dmg 1d4).

**Feral Female (1d4):** treat as 0-level human with AC 12 (crude hides),

A band of eight morlocks is prowling the Lower Levels of Dolmvay&#39;s
sewers seeking to unlock the mysteries of the great machines. Their
leader is a powerful morlock sorcerer named Varonaak Abruul. The
morlocks are not initially hostile—Varonaak is more interested in
discovering what the characters know about the magic of Dolmvay&#39;s
sewers. Once Varonaak has mined the characters&#39; knowledge, he and his
men launch a surprise attack.

**Varonaak Abruul (morlock sorcerer):** AL C; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 15 (chain

#### Shell Island
A dragon turtle has made its lair in a shallow underground lake fed by
several hot springs. The dragon turtle has been sleeping for the past
few decades and its shell appears as an algae-covered island in the
water. The dragon turtle wandered into the lake through an underwater
entrance that has since closed. If awakened, the hungry dragon turtle
devours everything in sight.

**Dragon Turtle:** AL C; MV 30&#39; (10&#39;)/Swim 90&#39; (30&#39;); AC -2 (natural);
HD 30; hp 211; \#AT 3 or 1; Dmg 1d8 (claw)/1d8 (claw)/1d6x10 (bite) or

breath weapon for 1/2 damage); SV F15; ML 10; XP 9,500.

#### Sleeping Giant
The characters find themselves on a ledge overlooking a vast cistern.
Below them, a sleeping storm giant lies motionless beneath the peaceful
waters. The storm giant&#39;s name is Korren Waraft and he is under an
ancient and powerful enchantment that leaves him frozen in place and
invulnerable to all attacks. Korren is one of several beings who once
helped tend the great machines of the Old World. He cannot be wakened by
anything short of *wish* magic. The DM is free to develop
Korren&#39;s story further, as needed.

**Korren Waraft (storm giant):** AL L; MV 150&#39; (50&#39;); AC 18 (natural); HD

1d3 hit points damage per round; SV F4; ML 7; XP 2,060.

#### Tunnel Slug
The characters realize the sewer floor is covered with a glistening,
sticky secretion. If they continue on, they walk right up to a giant
slug whose bulk blocks the entire tunnel. The startled slug attacks on
sight. If the party flees, the slug pursues them as best it can.

**Giant Slug:** AL N; MV 60&#39; (20&#39;); AC 12 (natural); HD 12; hp 90; \#AT
1; Dmg 1d12 (bite) or special; SA acid spittle causes 5d8 hit points

## NPC QUIRKS AND TRAITS

Tables for generating random NPCs and their traits may be found in the
**Random Tavern Patrons** section of the *Advanced Edition Companion™.*
The following quirks and traits may be introduced to give an NPC even
more personality or motivation.

**The NPC:**

1.  acts foppish and effete. The NPC has a razor sharp wit and is free
    with insults. The NPC is really a 6th level fighter who enjoys
    baiting others into personal duels.

2.  always carries an exotic pet perched on his/her shoulder, draped
    around his/her neck, or crawling through his/her clothing. Roll 1d6:
    1 (large spider), 2 (constrictor snake), 3 (flying squirrel), 4
    (dovecrow), 5 (chameleon lizard), 6 (large cockroach).

3.  always has a different infant in his/her arms. If asked about the
    infants, the NPC just smiles strangely and changes the subject. Roll
    1d6: 1-2 (the NPC does foster care work for the Church), 3-4 (the
    NPC is paid to care for infants while their parents conduct unsavory
    business), 5-6 (the NPC is helping a broklaw gang traffic human
    children).

4.  always wears at least one item of clothing made from reptile skin
    (belt, boots, etc.)

5.  breeds fighting dogs. The NPC pays street urchins to catch strays so
    he/she can use them as bait. The NPC has contacts among several
    different broklaws that fight these dogs for profit.

6.  can determine someone&#39;s alignment after spending only a short time
    with them.

7.  cannot be healed by magic. If the Church of Law and Order discovers
    this, the NPC may be branded a heretic.

8.  cheats at everything and cannot be trusted with games, secrets, or
    spouses.

9.  chews tobacco. The NPC always has a wad of tobacco in his/her mouth
    and spits at the most inappropriate times.

10. does not know how to dress properly. Roll 1d6: 1-2 (the NPC is
    extremely skinny and wears loose clothes that hang off his or her
    body), 3-4 (the NPC is grossly obese and wears tight clothes that
    reveal far too much), 5-6 (the NPC is extremely attractive and wears
    sexually provocative clothes that are inappropriate outside of the
    bedchamber or a brothel).

11. does not like children. The NPC always carries a switch and likes to
    swat children with it. The NPC may or may not have children of
    his/her own.

12. eats only raw meat. The NPC may or may not care how others feel
    about this.

13. exudes an anti-magic effect that makes spellcasters ill in his/her
    presence. Any magic-user or elf that comes within 10&#39; of the NPC
    must make a saving throw vs. spells or become weak and nauseous for
    1d6 rounds. During this time, the magic-user or elf character cannot
    cast spells and suffers a -2 to-hit and a -2 to AC.

14. forcefully shakes hands with male characters every time they meet.

15. has a green thumb. The NPC maintains a bountiful garden and knows
    everything there is to know about local flora.

16. has a malformed hand. Roll 1d6: 1-2 (birth defect), 3-4 (one or more
    amputated fingers), 5-6 (metal hook or spike).

17. has a masked alter ego known as the Lawgiver whose mission is to
    create dissent, destroy property, and otherwise disrupt the
    operations of various broklaw gangs. The NPC may take an active role
    in these activities or may hire others to do the work for him/her.

18. has a nervous twitch caused by a rare tick-like parasite known as a
    *dirtra* that has burrowed under his/her skin. If the PCs spend a
    lot of time in the NPC&#39;s presence, the *dirtra* parasite may
    transfer to a new host. The twitch imposes a -1 penalty to-hit and a
    -1 penalty to all saving throws. The parasite may only be killed by
    healing magic such as a *cure light wounds* spell or a home remedy
    of the DM&#39;s design.

19. has an easygoing personality and likes to cook meals for friends.

20. has an irrational fear of a certain type of animal. Roll 1d6: 1
    (dogs), 2 (cats), 3 (birds), 4 (insects), 5 (fish), 6 (reptiles).
    The NPC must make a morale check each round the animal is present.

21. has an unbelievable tolerance to pain. In combat, the NPC fights
    until reduced to -10 hit points before expiring from his/her wounds.

22. has an uncanny ability to know when the City Watch is coming.

23. has bad allergies that cause his/her eyes to water and his/her nose
    to run. The NPC constantly sneezes and dabs at his/her nose with a
    wet handkerchief. He/she sometimes asks others to hold the
    handkerchief while he/she fumbles with keys, food, or other items.

24. has been *charmed* by an evil wizard.

25. has been to the massive seawall and megadungeon known as the Great
    Valnwall.

26. has burn scars covering much of his or her body and face. The NPC
    always wears a mask in public and may be shunned by superstitious
    folk.

27. has converted to another religion and is secretly amassing followers
    to the worship of a new god and: Roll 1d6: 1-2 (believes he is a
    prophet who was chosen by the new god), 3-4 (believes he or she is
    the immortal incarnation of the new god), 5-6 (believes one of the
    PCs is the immortal incarnation of the new god).

28. has extremely bad breath. The NPC is generous and kind and would do
    anything for his friends, but is rarely invited to social events.

29. has eyeballs branded or tattooed on his/her eyelids, cheeks, and
    forehead.

30. has made a pact with a demon and his/her wealth, power, and
    influence is on the rise.

31. has only one eye. Roll 1d6: 1-2 (birth defect), 3-4 (lost in
    battle), 5-6 (lost in accident). A poor NPC may wear an eye patch
    while a wealthy NPC may possess a glass eye.

32. has pale skin and pink eyes that convey infravision to a range of
    30&#39;. The NPC is descended from a union of human and morlock blood.

33. has sailed across the Gulf of Valnwall and can provide detailed
    information on the coastal regions of the duchy.

34. has traveled across the Duchy of Valnwall and can provide detailed
    information on the lands outside the city walls.

35. is a true visionarre who has uncontrollable visions of
    past, present, and future events. The NPC occasionally slips off
    into a trance and begins reciting the things he/she sees. The NPC
    may or may not retain memories of these episodes.

36. hates a demihuman race. Roll 1d6: 1-2 (elves), 3-4 (dwarves), 5-6
    (halflings). This hatred may be the result of a past insult,
    religious doctrine, or simply a prejudiced upbringing. The NPC finds
    it difficult to hide his/her hatred and suffers -2 to all Reaction
    rolls when dealing with the hated race.

37. hates magic and magic-users. The NPC has difficulty hiding his
    disgust and suffers -2 to all Reaction rolls involving magic-users
    or elves. The NPC may or may not be part of a magic-hating faction
    such as the Order of the Noble Flame.

38. is a broklaw enforcer who commits (or arranges) violent acts against
    people who refuse to pay for protection.

39. is a social class pretender. If the NPC is common born, he/she
    dresses in finery and blends in at court or in other places where
    the wealthy and powerful gather. If the NPC is a noble, he/she often
    goes slumming in the rough taverns of Baytown, the Wharf District,
    or the River District.

40. is a conman. A few nights after befriending the party, the NPC
    offers to cut them in on a deal to buy property in the River
    District and sell it to the Warehouser&#39;s Guild. All the NPC needs is
    another 1,000 gp. . .

41. is a cross dresser who spends several nights each week in a rough
    neighborhood posing as a prostitute of the opposite sex.

42. is a former adventurer who decided to settle in Dolmvay after a very
    brief adventuring career. The NPC may become a good source of
    information about the lands outside the city.

43. is a former alman who was banned from the courts after being caught
    in a lie. The NPC is well versed in law and can still provide legal
    advice to friends.

44. is a former clergyman who left the Church after suffering a crisis
    of faith. Roll 1d6: 1-2 (the NPC has renounced all belief in a
    higher power), 3-4 (the NPC has converted to the worship of another
    religion), 5-6 (the NPC actively seeks to overthrow the Church of
    Law and Order). The NPC may or may not have changed his/her name to
    avoid persecution by the Church.

45. is a former pirate who is Wanted for piracy and murder. The NPC has
    changed his name and avoids the Wharf District, but may still be
    remembered by some.

    regrets his mistakes and seeks to help Watchmen and law-abiding
    citizens whenever possible.

47. is a germophobe. The NPC constantly washes his/her hands and often
    wears gloves.

48. is a kleptomaniac. The NPC frequently steals small items from shops,
    homes, and even the PCs&#39; belongings.

49. is a latent spellcaster. When under duress, the NPC reflexively
    casts one random magic-user spell. If this happens in public, a

    which is hidden in a secret vault beneath his/her home.

51. is a nobleman&#39;s bastard. The NPC may or may not have a claim to
    his/her father&#39;s lands and title.

52. is a pious person who never tells a lie. The NPC is a friend of the
    PCs who recently witnessed a crime committed by a powerful broklaw
    gang and has been warned to remain silent or suffer the
    consequences. This silence is eating at the NPC&#39;s conscience.

53. is a private inventor who loves to tinker with mundane gear.

54. is a serial killer who prefers poison and is responsible for the
    deaths of over twenty men (mostly master guildsmen). The characters

    the market for a new spouse and may set his/her eyes on one of the
    PCs.

56. is actually a doppleganger in disguise. This NPC can become a

    service. Roll 1d6: 1-2 (City Watch), 3-4 (King&#39;s Army), 5-6 (King&#39;s
    Navy).

76. is really a spy for the Empire of Xanne.

77. is ruthlessly ambitious and seeks to rise above his/her station by

    convince the church to heal him/her and is seeking revenge.

84. is suicidal and wants to make a suicide pact with someone else,

    things and can&#39;t stand saying goodbye.

92. pretends to be a mysterious creature of the night. The NPC is
    extremely pale, only comes out after dark, and either pays or

    Law and Order is made aware of the NPC&#39;s antics, they happily send
    an Inquisitor to investigate.

# APPENDIX V: TREASURES 

&gt; &quot;I say the City of Dolmvay is ripe for the picking. A few good thieves
&gt; could empty the Valenon Vault and be off before any of their infidel
&gt; priests can raise the alarm!&quot;  
&gt; —Ahmed &quot;the Desert Nomad&quot; al-Udin

The following section is designed to help DM&#39;s create
treasures on the fly. It includes rules for picking pockets, pick
pockets tables, and random tables for quality household treasures.

## PICKING POCKETS 

&gt; *DM: The Dolmvay Market is bustling with activity.
&gt; Merchants hawk their wares, minstrels play songs, and street urchins
&gt; beg for coppers as you pass. You push through the crowds on your way
&gt; to the Inn of the Red Flagon where a nobleman is supposedly looking to
&gt; hire a new set of bodyguards. As you reach the tavern and order a
&gt; tankard of ale, you realize your pockets have been picked.*  
&gt; *Player: \*sigh\* What did they take?*

How many times has something like this happened to you? How did your
DM decide what was stolen? Was it a few coins or was it
something more valuable like a jeweled bracelet or even a magic wand?
More importantly, did you feel cheated afterward?

In Old School play, thefts happen, and sometimes there is nothing your
character can do about them. That&#39;s just the way it is. However, in the
sense of fairness, the DM should use a system for picking
pockets that is as random as possible.

### NPC Thieves

The act of picking pockets is risky business for anyone except a skilled
thief. When picking pockets, an NPC thief almost always steals coins
unless he is looking for a specific item. The DM should roll
1d12 and consult the Theft Of table once a PC&#39;s pockets have been picked
to determine what was stolen.


|Theft Of||
|:---:|:---:|
|1-10|Coin|
|11-12|Item|


#### Coin

The thief steals 1d6 coins from the character. The DM should
roll 1d6 and consult the table below to determine which type of coins
were stolen. If the character does not possess the type and/or number of
coins rolled, the DM may roll again to make up the
difference.



|Coin Type||
|:---:|:---:|
|1|Copper|
|2|Silver|
|3|Electrum|
|4|Gold|
|5|Platinum|
|6|Roll again and increase the number by 1d4 coins|




#### Items

&gt; The DM can assume that most armor, larger weapons (such as
&gt; battle axes, long swords, etc.), and clothing worn by the character is
&gt; safe from pickpockets. Just about anything else is fair game, however,
&gt; including small items such as knives, adventuring equipment, gems,
&gt; jewelry, potions, and miscellaneous magic items.




|Item|Letter|
|:---:|:---:|
|1|B|
|2|C|
|3|D|
|4|F|
|5|G|
|6|H|
|7|J|
|8|K|
|9|L|
|10|M|
|11|N|
|12|P|
|13|Q|
|14|R|
|15|S|
|16|T|
|17|V|
|18|W|
|19|X|
|20|Z|





The DM should roll 1d20 and consult the Item Letter table to
find the corresponding letter. The DM should then consult
the player&#39;s character sheet and, reading from left to right, locate the
first appropriate item on the sheet that begins with that letter. This
determines the item stolen. If no items on the sheet begin with that
letter, match the rolled letter to the second letter of an appropriate
item. If no items contain the second letter, match the third, etc. If no
items contain the letter at all, roll again on the Item Letter table.

For example, the DM rolls an &quot;H&quot;. The first small item on
the character sheet that begins with an &quot;H&quot; is a &quot;holy symbol&quot;.
Therefore, the NPC thief steals the character&#39;s holy symbol. If the
DM rolled an &quot;M&quot; and no items on the sheet began with the
letter &quot;M&quot;, the second letter is used. Therefore, the character&#39;s
&quot;*amulet of the planes*&quot; is stolen.

### PC Thieves

When a PC thief picks an NPC&#39;s pockets, the player may decide if his
character is attempting to steal coins or items.

#### Coins

An NPC carries a number of coins based upon his wealth and status. A PC
thief who makes a successful pick pockets roll steals 2d4 coins of the
appropriate type.

|Coins|NPC|
|:---:|:---:|
| 1d8 gp |Noble               |
| 1d6 gp |Merchant            |
| 1d4 gp |Adventurer          |
| 1d6 sp |Craftsman/Tradesman |
| 1d6 cp |Watchman/Soldier    |
| 1d4 cp |Apprentice/Laborer  |

#### Items
If the character decides to steal an item, roll 1d6 and consult the
Stolen Item table, then follow the guidelines for each entry in order to
determine what type of item was stolen.

## HOUSEHOLD TREASURES

The wealthy nobles and merchants of Dolmvay measure their wealth in
possessions, assets, and property. A wealthy person&#39;s home is often
lavishly decorated in order to show off their station. On the practical
side, the wealthy know that high-quality items such as furniture,
artwork, and even common household goods are also much more difficult to
steal and fence than coins and jewelry.

Adventurers who &quot;dress the part&quot; in quality clothing, weapons, and armor
give off a perception of competence and success which often gains the
notice of wealthy prospective employers. After all, only successful
adventurers are able to afford the finer things in life. These employers
are more willing to offer higher rates and commissions than they would
to adventurers who are obviously accustomed to settling for less. At the
DM&#39;s discretion, the characters may receive a bonus of +1 or
+2 to Reaction rolls when dealing with citizens of Dolmvay who respect
adventurers. Accumulation of household treasures is also a good way to
manage excess treasure.

### Household Treasures

A wealthy man&#39;s household typically has 2d10 of the following items of
quality craftsmanship (in addition to a number of other mundane items).
These items are given a Base Value to represent their worth. Items that
are further adorned are given Multipliers that are applied to the Base
Value. These Multipliers are cumulative.

#### Treasure Type

Roll 1d6 to determine the type of treasure and then follow the
guidelines for each entry.

# OPEN GAME CONTENT

The *Guidebook to the City of Dolmvay* is largely open content (see the
Open Game Content section for details). Small Niche Games would like to
encourage professional and amateur publishers to use the *Guidebook* as
a shared city setting and set their commercial adventures within the
City of Dolmvay. DM&#39;s (and publishers) should feel free to
change, add, or remove any of the information in this book to better
suit his or her own game.

To that end, nothing in this book should be considered &quot;canon&quot;. The
*Guidebook* was written to be modular, allowing new NPCs, factions,
locations, and adventures to be created or removed without altering the
makeup of the overall city. This does NOT mean that larger changes are
forbidden. If you decide to publish an adventure where the Duke is
assassinated, or invading dragons devour half of Dolmvay&#39;s citizens, or
the entire North Ward gets sucked into an interdimensional rift, run
with it!

Just keep in mind that wholesale changes like these make it difficult
for other DM&#39;s (or publishers) to slot into their own
campaigns, which may detract from the utility of a shared city setting.
That said, this book is now yours to do with as you will.

# BAYTOWN

&gt; &quot;I can feel your pain, your grief—your *rage*. Tell me what ails you
&gt; child, and perhaps together we can set things aright.&quot;  
&gt; —Old Murtha

**Location:** On the shores of King&#39;s Bay, outside the walls of the
Wharf District.

**Neighborhoods:** Slums.

**Common Businesses:** Boat builders, brothels, butchers, churches,
fishmongers, inns, ropemaker/netmakers, taverns, warehouses.

**Watch Presence:** Low (Day); None (Night)

**Things to Remember:** This wretched slum neighborhood lies just
outside the city walls. It is a place of sin and vice that is shunned by
law-abiding folk. The taverns, inns, and brothels of Baytown are among
the worst dives in all of Dolmvay. Think poverty, unwashed sailors,
barroom brawls, clandestine meetings, and back alley murders

## Baygate
This small gate is kept closed and is seldom used. It provides access
from Baytown to the Guild District. The Baygate posting is considered an
unfavorable assignment and the Watchmen on duty here tend to be men of
shady character who had problems fitting in with members at other posts.

## Outer Docks
These docks lie outside the city walls and are capable of accommodating
even the largest sailing vessels. The docks are identified by female
names (Jennysdock, Margaretsdock, Elanasdock, etc.), with the names of
each dock inscribed on a wooden sign.

The docking fee is 1 cp piece for private vessels or 5% of the cargo&#39;s
value for merchant vessels. An additional 1 cp must be paid for every
week after the first. All fees are collected by an agent of the
Harbormaster, and all sailors and passengers must remain on board until
the fee is paid.

## Cave of the Sea God
This sea cave complex located on the northernmost shores of Baytown is
actually a shrine to an ancient reptilian sea god named Gurosulla. The
worship of Gurosulla began far across the sea in the mythical Lands of
the Rising Sun, where it is said that the gargantuan lizard was born of
a union between titan and sea dragon.

According to legend, Gurosulla chooses to dwell in the deepest parts of
the ocean, but occasionally surfaces to vent his wrath in the form of
hurricanes, whirlpools, volcanic eruptions, and tidal waves.

The Cave of the Sea God floods with the rising tide, drowning any who
are caught within. A crude stone altar bearing a statue of the bipedal
Gurosulla is located in the rearmost cave, and the cave floor is
littered with coins, trinkets, and the bones of drowned animals (and
some humans) that were left as sacrifices by local fishermen and
sailors. Anyone who takes one of these items suffers the Wrath of the
Sea God—any time the character enters water that is over his head, he
sinks to the bottom as if he weighed 1,000 pounds (see the *Labyrinth
Lord™* core rulebook for rules on drowning).

Certain spells cast on the character (such as *fly, levitate*, etc.)
allow the character to escape the water. Otherwise, the DM
must decide whether or not the character&#39;s companions have the strength
to rescue him. A *remove curse* spell cast by a cleric of at least 12th
level is needed to break the curse.

## Murtha&#39;s Hovel
This hovel is located at the end of one of Baytown&#39;s darkest and most
dangerous alleys. It is the home of the witch-woman Old Murtha who is said to practice dark wizardry for a fee. The hovel is lined
with dusty tomes, arcane objects, and shelves filled with strange
ingredients (eye of newt, tongue of frog, quicksilver lotus, etc.). The
hovel is protected by a powerful enchantment that obscures it from those
who wish Murtha harm.

## Atwater&#39;s Hall
Atwater&#39;s Hall is a one-story tavern that caters to some of Baytown&#39;s
less vile sailors, adventurers, and other clientele. The tavern consists
of a common taproom in front, with kitchens, private meeting chambers,
and the proprietor&#39;s quarters in the back. Atwater&#39;s Hall serves Common
quality meals. The tavern is owned and operated by the former sea
captain Lawrence Atwater.

## Ruins of Bearmont Tower
This crumbling tower ruin is an old watch fire that was meant to guide
ships to port and alert the city to invaders. It is a hollow five-story
structure with several rotted floors and a winding staircase that hugs
the wall all the way to the top. The tower is said to be haunted by the
ghosts of drowned sailors.

The tower was recently the site of a magical battle between two wizards
(see Bryan Sturlaker, and Barrugal the Infamous).

## Baytown Factions
The following factions may be encountered in Baytown.

### Watchers of the Gray Ice
The Watchers of the Gray Ice is a disreputable adventuring company that
is rumored to be in league with several pirate captains in the Gulf of
Valnwall. The Watchers have come to Dolmvay to scout out merchant
vessels and perhaps engage in a bit of thievery or piracy. Their
standard is a sinking ship run aground on a gray iceberg.

## Baytown NPCs of Note
The following NPCs may be encountered in Baytown.

### Lawrence Atwater
Lawrence Atwater is a friendly, bearded man who loves a good drink and a
tall tale. He is a former sea captain who owns and operates the
Atwater&#39;s Hall tavern in Baytown. Atwater appears to be involved in
numerous shady dealings, but this is only a cover. He was once a
successful smuggler who was eventually captured and imprisoned. In
exchange for an early release, Atwater agreed to work as an informant
for the King&#39;s Navy. Atwater now keeps tracks of the major thieves,
pirates, smugglers, and other criminals who frequent Baytown.

**Lawrence Atwater:** AL N; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 8 or 4 (chain mail + Dex);
F2; hp 11; \#AT 1; Dmg 1d4+1 (dagger + Str) or 1d8+1 (long sword + Str);

engraved with shark designs (55 gp), gold necklace with shark tooth
pendant (100 gp), 1d4 gp, 1d6 sp.

### Gantrios the Sea Raven
Gantrios is a tall, gentle man with weathered skin and long hair kept in
a topknot that is decorated with raven feathers. Gantrios lost his right
eye in a battle with the sea troll Salkevern and now wears a black eye
patch to cover the wound. Scars from the troll&#39;s claws extend from
beneath the patch and across Gantrios&#39;s nose.

Gantrios was a huntsman who became enamored with the sea. He has served
as a sailor, navigator, and guide for several sea-oriented adventuring
companies. Gantrios never goes anywhere without his companion, an
intelligent raven named Tinglint, so-named because of the silver streaks
in its beak. Gantrios and Tinglint share a magical bond that allows
Gantrios to see through the raven&#39;s eyes when he closes his own, as if
under the effects of a *clairvoyance* spell.

Gantrios spends most of his time in Baytown and the Wharf District where
he is currently tracking down rumors regarding the return of Mactorlla
the Sea Witch.

**Gantrios the Sea Raven:** AL N; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 14 (studded leather +
Dex); R3; hp 20; \#AT 1; Dmg 1d8+1 (longsword + Str), 1d6+1 (hand axe +

**Tinglint:** AL N; MV Fly 360&#39; (120&#39;); AC 8; HD 1d4 hit points; hp 4;
\#AT 1; 1 (beak); SA extremely intelligent, magical bond with Gantrios
the Sea Raven; SV 0-level human; ML 7; XP 6.

### James of the Stormcrow
James is a lithe, heavily-muscled man with a wicked half moon scar over
his left eye that starts on his forehead and ends on his chin. James
grew up in the Orphanage of St. Lucilla where he quickly established
himself as an honorable and trustworthy lad who refused to allow himself
or others to be bullied.

As a child, James enjoyed watching the ships sail in and out of King&#39;s
Bay. He was eventually offered a place in the Brotherhood of St. Brandon
the Navigator, but decided to join the King&#39;s Navy when he came of age
rather than pursue a career in the clergy.

James is an excellent fighter who has served as a marine aboard several
naval vessels including the Lord High Admiral&#39;s own *Lady Justice*. He
received the scar on his face while fighting the pirate captain War
Brand aboard a sinking ship during the Battle of the Riven Hulls.

James now sails with a private crew aboard a ship named the *Stormcrow*
that hires out to protect merchant vessels from pirates and other
threats. He is a pious man who still pays homage to St. Brandon and
tithes most of his earnings to the church. James still has many contacts
in the navy.

James has fallen in love with a serving girl named Mora Nettles who
works at Atwater&#39;s Hall in Baytown. When James is in port, he spends
most of his time there and plans to ask for her hand in marriage once he
has saved enough to buy a good home. James may join an adventuring
company for an adventure at sea, or the party may hire the *Stormcrow*
to transport them somewhere in the Gulf of Valnwall.

**James of the Stormcrow:** AL L; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 13 (Dex) or 6

ML 9; XP 245; holy symbol of St. Brandon, 1d6 gp, 1d4 sp, 1d6 cp.

### Bears of Tallrock
Bears is a tall, bald-headed sailor with scars crisscrossing his body.
He is a violent criminal who has spent most of his life in the rougher
port cities across the Duchy of Valnwall and has no respect for
authority.

Bears enjoys the company of the sorceress Florynn Dossum, but is one of
the few men who is immune to her charms. He is the current leader of an
adventuring company known as the Watchers of the Gray Ice.

**Bears of Tallrock:** AL C; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 16 (leather armor + Dex);

ML 9; XP 800; short sword with gold and silver pommel (70 gp), ten small garnets (15
gp each), brass compass, *Thieve&#39;s Tools*, 1d10 gp, 1d12 sp.

### Florynn Dossum
Florynn is a sultry brunette who was born to a wealthy merchant family
in Bay City. Florynn seduced her uncle and convinced him to teach her
magic. She enjoys manipulating others, especially through spells. She is
accustomed to getting her way and sees Bears of Tallrock as a challenge
because she has thus far been unable to control him.

**Florynn Dossum:** AL C; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 12 (Dex); MU3; hp 8; \#AT 1;
Dmg 1d4 (dagger); S 9, D 16, C 10, I 15, W 13, Ch 14; SV MU3; SA

### Ila Longbraid
Ila is the daughter of a scullery maid who worked in the Ducal Palace.
Ila spent most of her childhood attending to noble children, acting as a
playmate, brushing their hair, and helping them bathe and dress. Ila
grew to despise the nobility and decided to become an adventurer to
escape her life. Ila has long black hair that she works into elaborate

&gt; &quot;A dead wyvern, it was. I saw them unloading it meself. Teeth as long
&gt; as me arm, stinger as long as me leg. They say it was bound for some
&gt; clink&#39;s menagerie, but got loose and killed ten sailors before they
&gt; put it down.&quot;  
&gt; —gossip at the Full Sail Inn

**Location:** The southwest corner of the South Ward on the shores of
King&#39;s Bay.

fishmongers, inns, ropemaker/netmakers, taverns, warehouses.

**Watch Presence:** Moderate (Day); Low (Night).

**Things to Remember:** The Wharf District is one of the most chaotic
districts in Dolmvay. Think the smell of the open sea, fishermen
haggling over the day&#39;s catch, ships sailing in and out of King&#39;s Bay,
teamsters loading and unloading cargo, raucous taverns and brothels, and
foreign sailors from all over Amherth.

## Wharf Gate
The Wharf Gate is a seagate that provides smaller sea vessels access to
and from the Inner Docks. The mutilated bodies of pirates are often
hanged from the gate&#39;s arches as a warning to those who pass beneath.

## Harvest Gate
The Harvest Gate, also known as Southgate, provides entry to the Wharf
District. The Harvest Road passes through the gate, leading to farmlands
that supply much of Dolmvay and beyond. The Harvest Gate provides easy
access to the wharf and the Dolmvay Market.

## Inner Docks
These docks lie within the city walls and are capable of accommodating
smaller vessels. The docks are identified by colors (Greendock, Reddock,
Bluedock, etc.). Each dock is painted its respective color.

The docking fee is 1 sp for private vessels or 5% of the cargo&#39;s value
for merchant vessels. An additional 1 cp must be paid for every week
after the first. All fees are collected by an agent of the Harbormaster
and all sailors and passengers must remain on board until the fee is
paid.

## Shrine of St. Brandon the Navigator
Brandon of Vay was a venerated navigator and sea captain who was known
for his selfless acts of charity and efforts to stop piracy in the Gulf
of Valnwall. Upon his death, the church named him a patron saint of
sailors.

The shrine consists of a church located inside the drydocked hull of a
sailing vessel named the *Navigator&#39;s Eye* where services are held
throughout the week. St. Brandon is honored with prayers and small gifts
by fishermen and sailors of all alignments.

## The Golden Earring

quarters. These quarters contain numerous poison dart traps that protect

overlooking the central pit. A wine cellar is located below.

by costumed fan favorites. The Mare&#39;s Head Theater serves Poor quality
meals. It is owned and operated by a greedy, immoral man named Wayen

## Bekker&#39;s Treasures
Bekker&#39;s Treasures is a small thrift shop owned and operated by Bekker
of Malthaven. The shop lies on the border of the Wharf District and the
Guild District and is full of ridiculously high-priced junk. That is
because the shop is simply a front where Bekker arranges jobs for thugs,
smugglers, and thieves.

Bekker&#39;s Treasures is located in the Malthaven Brewery Quarter and those
not accustomed to being near a brewery guildworks find the smell almost
unbearable. Bekker lives in a small apartment above the shop.

## Citadel of Honored Sailors
This impressive stone building was once a temple to an ancient and wild
sea goddess known as Amakil the Blue Tempest. The temple was gutted by
fire ages ago and has since been converted to an indoor/outdoor market
with shops, taverns, stalls, a chapel, and other businesses that cater
mostly to merchants and sailors.

The citadel&#39;s central hall is a nautical museum that contains the
remnants of ancient vessels, naval artifacts, statues depicting famous
Valinian captains, and historical information regarding the Gulf of
Valnwall. A number of rumors also abound of hidden chambers and ancient
treasures locked deep away in the secret vaults beneath the former
temple.

## Wharf District Factions
The following factions may be encountered in the Wharf District.

### Brotherhood of Injured Sailors

The Brotherhood of Injured Sailors is a Beggars&#39; Guild made up of former
sailors who have been seriously injured or become too old to work on the

River, and Market Districts.

# GUILD DISTRICT

&gt; &quot;Stitch, stitch, stitch,  
&gt; In poverty, hunger, and dirt,  
&gt; Sewing at once, with a double thread,  
&gt; A shroud as well as a shirt.&quot;  
&gt; *—The Song of the Shirt*

**Location:** Southwest side of the South Ward, abutting the Dolm River.

**Neighborhoods:** Lower-class with some middle-class

**Common Businesses:** Armorers, blacksmiths, breweries, cobblers,
churches, guildworks, leatherworkers, mills, stockyards, taverns,
warehouses.

**Watch Presence:** Low (Day); Moderate (Night).

**Things to Remember:** The guild district is home to a number of
warehouses, stockyards, granaries, mills, and guildworks, as well as
living quarters for the laborers and craftsmen who work in them. The
Guild District extends both above and below street level (known as the
Underguild), with almost as many streets, shops, homes, and guildworks
found underground as there are above.

Think rough workers, the sounds of chipping at stone and hammer on
anvil, dank staircases leading to underground tunnels, and the smell of
fresh blood, offal, and rotting carcasses.

## Guild Gate
The Guild Gate provides access to the Guild Docks from the Dolm River.
The gates remain open throughout the day and night, with barges and
other vessels being loaded and unloaded at all hours.

## Guild Docks
These orderly docks along the Dolm River are used only for official
guild business. The docks are identified by numbered signs (Dock One,
Dock Two, Dock Three, etc.). The Guild Docks lie about 10&#39; to 20&#39; below
street level and are accessed either by stone staircases that hug the
river walls or by entrances to the underground Guild District. They
operate all hours of the day and night.

## The Red Mill
The Red Mill is located entirely underground and is one of several local
mills powered by water routed from the Dolm. The Red Mill is famous for
its large red wheels. These wheels are made from the water-resistant
hardwood of the *arajo* tree which was imported from Mujabi.

The number of work-related deaths at the Red Mill is higher than any
other guildworks, and the mill is said to be cursed. Adventurers are
occasionally hired to clear giant rats, giant centipedes, and other even
stranger vermin from the mill&#39;s lower levels and sewer runoffs.

## Church of St. James the Elder
St. James the Elder is the Patron Saint of Laborers. The church compound
consists of a rectory for the priest, acolyte dorms, a garden shrine,
and a hilt-shaped stone chapel where worshipers can stop in to pray and
leave offerings.

## The Cold Iron Brew
The Cold Iron Brew is one of several local taverns frequented mainly by
guild workers who stop by to unwind after a hard day&#39;s work. Guild
workers tend to keep to themselves, but as drinks begin to flow,
arguments and brawls are not uncommon.

Antique and modern weapons and armor native to the Valnwall region are
firmly affixed to the tavern&#39;s walls. The tavern opens late in the
afternoon and closes shortly after midnight. The Cold Iron Brew serves
Common quality meals. It is owned and operated by the former blacksmith
Starn Falkirk.

## Demihuman Quarter
The Demihuman Quarter, also known as &quot;The Reek&quot;, is home to the majority
of the (mostly outcast) demihumans living in Dolmvay. The Reek borders
several large guildworks stockyards, tanneries, fish factories,
breweries, and slaughterhouses, and draws its nickname from the
overpowering smells that tend to gather in this slum. The demihumans
live here in squalid conditions, with the elves occupying the
dilapidated buildings, dwarves dwelling in the sewers, and halflings
forced to live in the streets.

## The Squick
The Squick is a seedy underground tavern located beneath The Reek. It is
owned and operated by a surly, bearded halfling named Camden Dewers.
Dewers hates humans. Human patrons can expect to receive moldy bread,
week-old meat, and watered down drinks served in filthy mugs. The Squick
serves Common quality meals to demihumans and Poor quality meals to
humans.

## Guild District Factions
The following factions may be encountered in the Guild District.

The Duchy of Valnwall maintains close ties with the city-states of
Guildeland, and the local guilds have a strong presence in Dolmvay. The
guilds decide price ranges, guard trade secrets, provide quality
control, and monitor those who practice certain trades or professions.
Many guilds also take an active role in politics.

The typical guild hierarchy consists of apprentices, journeymen, master
craftsmen, and headmasters.

Apprentices learn the basics of the trade or craft and perform menial
tasks for their masters for a period of five to seven years. The master
craftsman either pays the apprentice a (typically small) daily wage or
provides food, clothing, and lodging. The more fortunate apprentices are
invited into the homes of a master craftsman and treated like a member
of the family, but most end up working in guildworks factories.

Journeymen have completed an apprenticeship in their chosen trade or
craft and are allowed to open their own businesses, however, they may
not employ apprentices. Many journeyman are hired as guildworks foremen
while they continue to hone their craft. In order to become a master, a
journeyman must submit an exceptional piece of work for review by a
board of master craftsmen.

A master craftsman is a full-fledged member of the guild. He is allowed
to employ apprentices and journeymen and receive all the benefits and
protections the guild has to offer. Master craftsmen may also hold
positions of authority within the guild (treasurer, liaison, etc.).

The Headmaster is the head of the local guild. Each guild in Dolmvay has
its own Headmaster.

### Sewerman&#39;s Guild

The Sewerman&#39;s Guild is responsible for maintaining the city&#39;s sewers.
Entering Dolmvay&#39;s magical sewers is a dangerous job that is not for the
faint of heart. A sewerman is expected to train with weapons, but are
taught to avoid combat if possible. Sewermen routinely venture into the
sewers to clear minor blockages, map changes, install new drains and
other features, and drive off infestations of giant rats, alligators,
and gronted animals.

The Sewerman&#39;s Guild is always happy to trade information with and work
alongside adventuring companies. Sewermen carry sewer spears (a
combination gaff hook and spear) and wear specially designed waterproof
leather hoods, clothing, and armor, all of which are dyed yellow. The
Sewerman&#39;s Guild headquarters is located in a small walled compound in
the Guild District, with smaller offices all over the city. Their
standard is a black drain grate on a yellow background.

### Thieves&#39; Guild

The Thieves&#39; Guild is alive and well in Dolmvay, but prefers to keep a
very low profile. The guild&#39;s headquarters is located in the Guild
District and consists of a simple apartment building whose bored members
seem more concerned with tracking and recording crime statistics
throughout Dolmvay. The guild&#39;s activities here are closely monitored by
the Church of Law and Order, however, this building is simply a front.

The real members of the Thieves&#39; Guild are divided into cells that
rarely interact outside of meetings between cell leaders. These thieves
are masters of their craft, who pride themselves on their ability to
commit thefts without complications or unforeseen trouble, unlike the
more violent broklaw gangs who tend to draw the attention of the City
Watch. The Thieves&#39; Guild standard is a kraken which symbolizes the
guild&#39;s many arms, and this symbol is often worked into its member&#39;s
tattoos.

### Treasurer&#39;s Guild

One of the most powerful guilds in Dolmvay, the Treasurer&#39;s Guild is
responsible for recording all guild operations, collecting taxes from
guild members, and paying guild taxes to royal tax collectors. The
Treasurer&#39;s Guild keeps meticulous records and its tax collectors rarely
make mistakes.

The guild headquarters is a fortress that lies at the center of a walled
compound in the heart of the Guild District. Its vaults are said to be
guarded by a variety of mundane and magical monsters and traps. The
guild also employs several adventuring companies to protect their
members and assets.

### Moneylender&#39;s Guild

The Moneylender&#39;s Guild is an association of wealthy merchants and
businessmen who grant loans, trade in foreign currency, and store
private wealth in secure vaults. The guild also offers standard
accounting services to wealthy businessmen and noblemen.

Interest on loans is generally between 5% to 25%, depending on whether
or not the person needing money possesses any collateral. Foreign or
ancient coins may be exchanged for a 5% fee of the total value. Coins
and other valuables may be stored in the vault for a flat fee of 50 gp
per month.

The Moneylender&#39;s Guild is backed by several powerful merchant families
of Guildeland and is extremely influential in Dolmvay. Like the
Treasurer&#39;s Guild, the guild employs several independent adventuring
companies to protect its assets.

### The Society of Ear, Beard, and Foot

The Society of Ear, Beard, and Foot, a.k.a. the EBF, is a broklaw gang
made up entirely of demihumans. The EBF operates mainly in the Demihuman
Quarter known as &quot;The Reek&quot;, offering protection from humans in exchange
for coin, goods, and favors. The EBF is led by a council of seven
demihumans—three halflings, two dwarves, and two elves—each of whom are
more interested in personal gain than the betterment of other demihumans
living in the Reek.

## NPCs of Note

feelings of melancholy, earning him the nickname &quot;Weeping Will&quot;. Anyone
who mocks this name is subject to his fury.

Weeping Will recently stumbled upon Kertis of Pig Street looting a
sleeping merchant in a Pig Street alley. Will chased Kertis off and then
killed the merchant in a fit of rage after finding nothing of value.
Weeping Will has since spread the word that he witnessed Kertis murder
the merchant.

### Salindra &quot;Sally&quot; Rowanberry
Sally is a strikingly beautiful elf with a lithe figure, dark brown
hair, porcelain skin, and green, almond-shaped eyes. She is kindhearted
and blessed with a natural charm and charisma that often enables her to
influence others without having to resort to threats or violence.

Sally was born in the realm of the Wood Elf King and spent many years
honing her skills as scout, hunter, and spy. Her ranging often brought
her into contact with other races who lived near the forest and, her
curiosity piqued, she bid farewell to friends and family and set out to
explore the larger world.

During her travels she met the half-ogruk known as &quot;Bash&quot; and the two
became fast friends. Sally and Bash eventually joined up with a
mercenary named Broco and rose to the rank of lieutenants in his
company, the Homeless Men. The company is currently out of work and
Sally is busy trying to exploit tensions between Dolmvay&#39;s more
aggressive nobles and merchant houses.

### Bash the Hugruk
Bash is a hulking human-ogruk hybrid who stands eight feet tall and
weighs almost five hundred pounds. His skin has a greenish tinge and he
keeps his black hair cut short. Bash dresses in clothes made of
roughspun cloth and exudes a strong odor that many find unpleasant.

Bash was raised in his mother&#39;s ogre clan. Always more intelligent than
his kin, he eventually left the clan in search of adventure. Salindra
&quot;Sally&quot; Rowanberry was the first stranger he met on the road who did not
immediately run away. Sally&#39;s natural charm instantly won him over and
he has been infatuated with her ever since.

After a few brief adventures, Sally and Bash joined up with Broco and
his Homeless Men where their unique blend of beauty and brawn made them
invaluable. Bash is never far from Sally&#39;s side. He is indifferent to
the prejudice he experiences from both humans and demihumans in Dolmvay,
but usually lurks in the Underguild in order to avoid trouble with
citizens or the Watch.

# OLDCASTLE DISTRICT

&gt; &quot;Oldcastle was once *the* castle, home of the Duke and his family. I&#39;d
&gt; wager its walls hold secrets better left uncovered.&quot;  
&gt; —Captain Willam Foster

**Location:** Central area of the South Ward.

**Neighborhoods:** Middle-class with some lower-class.

**Common Businesses:** Armorers, blacksmiths, bowyers, churches,
hostlers, inns, leatherworkers, moneylenders, scholars (almen), taverns.

**Watch Presence:** Moderate (Day); Low (Night)

**Things to Remember:** The Oldcastle District was the first city
district established in Dolmvay and its buildings are made almost
entirely of stone. Think City Watchmen entering and leaving the
barracks, citizens of Dolmvay bringing grievances before the courts, and
public executions and other punishments.

## Oldcastle
This sturdy fortress was once the seat of Duke Dolm&#39;s power. After the
Ducal Palace was constructed in Z350, Oldcastle became the home of the
City Watch. It is here that the Watchlord of Dolmvay and his advisors
hear grievances, sentence offenders, and oversee other day-to-day
matters of law and order. The dungeons of Oldcastle are feared by
criminals all over the Duchy.

## Watch Barracks
This barracks compound is the main barracks of the City Watch. It
consists of a mess hall, stables, kennels, and several long barracks and
private dorms occupied mainly by unmarried City Watchmen.

## St. Raymont&#39;s Square
St. Raymont was a warrior-priest who was known for his strict morals and
devotion to law and order. Also known as Punishment Square, this open
courtyard contains stocks, cages, whipping posts, and a stone dais used
for public hangings, beheadings, and other executions.

The Watchlord&#39;s balcony overlooks St. Raymont&#39;s Square and it is
customary for the Watchlord to lead the prayer to St. Raymont that is
said before executions. For lesser punishments, the prayer is led by
members of the local church.

## King&#39;s Justice
This tavern is frequented mainly by City Watchmen, almen, clerks, and
others who work in the Oldcastle District. It is a one-story structure
that consists of a common taproom, kitchens, and a few private chambers
in the rear. The King&#39;s Justice serves Common quality meals. It is owned
and operated by the former watch captain Ronnad of Baytown.

## Silver Orb
The Silver Orb is a pawnbroking and moneylender&#39;s shop owned and
operated by a former adventurer named Cadfan the Moneylender. The shop
caters mainly to those wishing to borrow money to pay fines, and the
shop contains an odd mixture of junk and useful items. Cadfan is known
to buy, sell, and trade exotic goods with adventurers, and the shop is
said to have untold wealth and several magical items hidden away in a
secret underground vault. Cadfan lives alone in a small apartment above
the shop.

## Oldtower
Oldtower, also known as the Tower of the Fallen Lady, was used to house
political prisoners until the year Z298 when the Duchess Alleson was
found guilty of adultery. Rather than have her executed for treason,
Duke Robilard val Dolm chose to imprison her in the tower.

Duchess Alleson died shortly after in a mysterious fire that consumed
the upper levels of the tower, but her body was never recovered, and
some legends say she made a dark pact with a fire demon in order to win
her freedom. Oldtower was never restored and is said to be cursed.

## Factions of Note
The following NPCs and factions may be encountered in the Oldcastle
District.

### Almen&#39;s Guild
Almen are scholars who specialize in interpreting the laws of Dolmvay
and representing citizens in open court. Almen work closely with the
Church of Law and Order and adhere to a code of ethics. They often take
on the role of private investigators and sometimes hire adventurers to
help exonerate their clients. The Almen&#39;s Guild is located in the
Oldcastle District. Their standard is a sword and a balanced scale.

## Oldcastle District NPCs
The following NPCs may be encountered in the Oldcastle District.

### Ronnad of Baytown

operates the King&#39;s Justice tavern in the Oldcastle District. Born in

can be a great source of information regarding the nuances of Dolmvay
laws. Ronnad has many contacts among local almen and the City Watch.

found some magical (or unholy) way to preserve his youth.

Cadfan is a former adventuring fighter who enjoys boasting about all of

a lazy man who does just enough work to appease his superiors and
nothing more. Watchman Brannen can usually be found enjoying a mug of
ale in a back alley tavern named the Brass Window.

**Brannen Algood:** treat as 0-level human with AC 15 (chain mail), hp 3,
spear (Dmg 1d6), long sword (Dmg 1d8), dagger (Dmg 1d4), and 1d4 cp.

of thefts. He has many contacts among local fences and moneylenders and

hp 15; \#AT 1; Dmg 1d8+1 (long sword + Str), 1d4+1 (dagger + Str); S 13,

The City Watchlord oversees the day-to-day running of the City Watch and
the Lawguard. The current Watchlord is a veteran Watchmen named Jonnen

### Judge Tomas Edwards
Judge Edwards is a pious older man who has dedicated his life to
upholding the laws of Dolmvay. He began his career as an alman and
quickly rose to the upper ranks of his guild. He was appointed a
judgeship at a young age and has earned a reputation as an honest and
fair judge whose punishments usually match the crime. Judge Edwards
despises violent crimes, and a murderer who comes before him can only
hope for a quick death.

# MARKET DISTRICT
&gt; &quot;A toast to brave adventurers, just returned from the Ruklands to the
&gt; north! Hail Law!&quot;  
&gt; —George Manes

**Location:** Southeast side of the city.

**Neighborhoods:** Middle-class and lower-class.

**Common Businesses:** Any.

**Watch Presence:** Moderate (Day); Low (Night).

**Things to Remember:** The Market District is where the citizens of
Dolmvay come for entertainment, strange sights, and low prices. Think
haggling in the open market, brightly colored clothing, fluttering
banners, street vendors hawking their wares, street performers, and
foreign merchants from all over Amherth.

## Market Gate
The Market Gate provides entry to the Market District and opens directly
onto the chaos of the Dolmvay Market. The Dolmvay Road passes through
the Market Gate and is used mainly by farmers and herders to transport
livestock and goods to the city.

## Dolmvay Market
The Dolmvay Market lies just inside the Market Gate. It is a sprawling
selection of open streets, fountain squares, auction blocks, livestock
corrals, and vendor&#39;s stalls, boxed in by permanent shops, inns, and
taverns. The market bustles with activity throughout the day, but quiets
down considerably at night.

## Inn of the Red Flagon
This large, modern inn is frequented mainly by adventurers and
prospective employers. It is a four-story structure with a fenced
courtyard and stables out back, and a cellar below. The first floor
consists of a common taproom and kitchens. The second floor contains
private quarters and common sleeping chambers. The third and fourth
floors contain quality guest accommodations.

The Red Flagon common room provides a variety of entertainment including
minstrels, poets, dancing fools, and animal shows. The taproom is lined
with adventuring trophies such as maps of far off lands, foreign
clothing, and exotic weapons and armor. A shrine and statue of St.
Ronnad of the Flagon is located near the main fireplace.

The Inn of the Red Flagon serves Good quality meals. Their most famous
drink is the Red Dragon, a heady brew that is lit on fire and served in
the tavern&#39;s signature red flagon. The tavern is owned and operated by
George Manes.

## The Pig Whistle
The Pig Whistle is one of the few pork slaughterhouses allowed outside
of the Guild District. This is because the pigs are kept penned in
large, filthy, underground chambers that adjoin the sewers. The ground
floor of the Pig Whistle is a butcher shop that sells excellent cuts of
pork. The Pig Whistle is owned and operated by the wereboar Borlen
Thammer.

## The Painted Wheel
The Painted Wheel is a wainwright&#39;s shop owned and operated by the
halfling Tobias Quiggley. The shop is a two-story building that consists
of a small office on the first floor and a cramped apartment on the
second floor. A barn-like workshop occupies an open courtyard out back.
Tobias builds and repairs wagons, carts, and carriages and there are 1d6
wagons and carts being worked on at any given time. When necessary,
Tobias contracts local artists to adorn expensive, custom-made wagons
and carriages with paintings and carvings.

## Orphanage of St. Lucilla
This fenced compound is owned and operated by the Church of Law and
Order. Its mission is to house, feed, and educate Dolmvay&#39;s orphans in
order to help them reintegrate into society and become active members of
the church. The orphanage&#39;s reputation has been marred by negligence and
corruption and it has gone through several periods of reform.

## The Open Temple
The Open Temple is a three-story curio shop owned and operated by Abah
the Dealer. The shop specializes in foreign goods and contains an
assortment of exotic artwork, weapons, armor, clothing, and household
items (lamps, furniture, tableware, etc.) from all over Amherth.
Adventurers who frequent the shop have occasionally uncovered a rare
magic item mixed in with normal items on display. Abah lives in a small
cottage in the shop&#39;s backyard.

## Trep&#39;s Footwear
This cobbler&#39;s shop is located on Shoe Street amid several other rival
cobblers&#39; shops. The first floor contains a display room in front with a
workshop in the rear and a cellar below. The second floor contains the
private quarters of Neason Trep.

Trep is a former thief and member of the Thieves&#39; Guild. For a price of
100 gp, Trep can construct a pair of custom soft leather boots that add
+5% to a thief&#39;s move silently skill. These boots have a tendency to
wear out quickly and are only good for 1d3 uses before wearing thin. A
secret room adjoining Trep&#39;s root cellar is sometimes used as a safe
house or meeting place for Wanted thieves.

## Market District Factions of Note
The following factions may be encountered in the Market District.

### Society of the Noble Flame
The Society of the Noble Flame is a loosely organized faction of
magic-hating citizens that blames magic for most of society&#39;s woes. The
Society attempts to track the activities of magic-users, elves, and
other non-clerical spellcasters. Citizens accused of using illegal
sorcery against others are kidnapped, tried, and burned at the stake if
found guilty.

A number of citizens have raised complaints about the Society&#39;s tactics,
but the City Watch has been slow to investigate and some suggest the
Church of Law and Order secretly backs the Society of the Noble Flame.
The Society of the Noble Flame has several secret meeting spots, but the
one most often used is a hidden underground chamber in the Market
District. Their standard is a holy hilt wreathed in flames.

## NPCs of Note
The following NPCs may be encountered in the Market District.

### George Manes
George Manes owns and operates the Inn of the Red Flagon. Manes has been
a tavernkeeper all his life. He has three sons and a daughter, all of
whom took up adventuring as their trade. Manes misses them dearly and
has a soft spot for adventurers in need.

**George Manes:** treat as 0-level human with AC 9, hp 3, dagger (Dmg
1d4), and 1d6 sp.

### Neason Trep
The wiry Neason Trep is a former thief and an active member of the
Thieves&#39; Guild (a tattoo of a kraken climbing over the city walls is
located on his right shoulder blade). Trep is a skilled cobbler who owns
Trep&#39;s Footwear. He specialized in burglaries and still has contacts
among the city planners and mapmakers in Dolmvay. If befriended, Trep
could provide an excellent source of information on the floorplans and
layouts of most city buildings.

**Neason Trep:** AL N; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 12 (Dex); T4; hp 13; \#AT 1; Dmg
1d4 (dagger) or 1d6 (short sword); S 9, D 15, C 13, I 12, W 11, Ch 9; SV
T4; ML 8; XP 345; *potion of water breathing*, gold kraken
ring with tentacles encircling finger (75 gp), onyx and silver earring
(10 gp), *Thieve&#39;s Tools*, 1d4 gp, 1d6 sp, 1d4 cp.

### Vlarkvlaaran (a.k.a. &quot;Vlaarn&quot; or &quot;Vlark&quot;)
Vlarkvlaaran is a grizzled Gundamark dwarf with green eyes, a gray-brown
beard, and battle scars over much of his body. The dwarvish rune for &quot;X&quot;
is branded into his right cheek, just above his beard, marking him as an
exile, but he refuses to speak about his past.

Vlarkvlaaran is callous, rude, and always appears drunk (although he may
just be faking). He is a common sight in the seediest taverns, and
usually frequents several each night (sometimes after being tossed out
for drunken brawling). Vlarkvlaaran likes to drink and fight with a
rough crowd and has a wide knowledge of bawdy human and dwarven drinking
songs.

Almost 30 years ago, Vlarkvlaaran&#39;s entire dwarven enclave was wiped out
by a trio of dragons known as the Ascension. The other Gundamark clans
rallied to defeat the dragons, but refused Vlarkvlaaran&#39;s help. Many of
those familiar with what came to be known as the War of the Ascension
Wyrms believe (wrongly) that Vlarkvlaaran was actually in league with
the dragons.

Vlarkvlaaran has spent most of his exile in Dolmvay and has an intimate
knowledge of the city&#39;s magical sewer system. Vlarkvlaaran currently
lives in an abandoned part of the sewers. He knows the secret cellar
entrance to most taverns and uses these entrances to steal drinks or
appear seemingly out of nowhere.

Vlarkvlaaran possesses a magical *ring of quick sober* that enables him
to neutralize the effects of alcohol at will. He is extremely wealthy,
although one could never tell by his demeanor and style of dress.
Vlarkvlaaran has secretly willed his entire fortune to a young serving
wench named Denay who works in the Inn of the Red Flagon. Denay takes
pity on Vlarkvlaaran, chides him on his drinking, and always tries to
make sure he has had enough to eat.

**Vlarkvlaaran:** AL N; MV 90&#39; (30&#39;); AC 15 (studded leather + shield +
Dex); D3; hp 27; \#AT 1; Dmg 1d6+1 (*hand axe+1*), 1d4 (dagger); S 12, D
15, C 17, I 11, W 15, Ch 9; SA infravision 60&#39;, detect stone traps and
unusual stone construction on 1-2 on 1d6; SV D3; ML 8; XP 95; *ring of
quick sober;* 8,000 gp (kept in a Guildeland bank), (1d10 x 15) gp.

### Kormydigar the Summoner
Kormydigar was a young wizard who specialized in the dangerous art of
summoning and commanding demons. Years of interacting with these unholy
creatures finally drove him mad.

Kormydigar and several of his companions were eventually captured in the
Market District by agents of the Church of Law and Order and taken to
the Valenon for questioning. Kormydigar attempted to unleash a demon on
his captors, but a sudden backlash of energy from attempting the
summoning on sacred ground produced an explosion that killed several
priests and blew a hole in one of the church&#39;s walls.

Kormydigar&#39;s companions escaped in the confusion, but no trace of
Kormydigar was ever found. Some say he was killed in the blast, but many
believe he escaped to some demonic realm and is plotting his return.

**Kormydigar the Summoner:** AL C; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 15 (*bracers of AC
6* + Dex); MU6; hp 19; \#AT 1; Dmg 1d6 (quarterstaff); S 9, D 13, C 9, I

&gt; &quot;In the Light we suffer, in the Light we strive, in the Light we
&gt; overcome. *Avalen*.&quot;  
&gt; *—common prayer*

**Location:** On the southern banks of the Dolm River.  
**Neighborhoods:** Middle-class.  
**Common Businesses:** Any (mainly churches and scholars).  
**Watch Presence:** High (Day); Moderate (Night). The Valenon maintains
its own armed patrols known as Hiltamen that are not part
of the City Watch.  
**Things to Remember:** The Valenon is the heart of the Church of Law
and Order. It is the center of religious power in Dolmvay as well as the
Duchy of Valnwall. The church considers itself the voice of the common
people and as such it is fittingly located in the South Ward. Think
robed monks, religious bells, and pilgrimages from all over the duchy.


## Valenon Docks
These private docks are used only for church business. The docks are
named after various saints (St. Lucilla&#39;s Dock, St. Brandon&#39;s Dock, St.
Kristoff&#39;s Dock, etc.) and bear a statue of their respective saints. The
docks lie about 10&#39; to 20&#39; below street level and are accessed by stone
staircases that hug the river walls.

## Gates of St. Poul
These gates provide access to the Valenon Docks. Only vessels on
official church business are allowed to pass through this gate.

## Eastgate and Westgate
These manned gates provide access to and from the Valenon. The gates are
closed at night.

## Cathedral of St. Poul of the Shield
This enormous cathedral is dedicated to St. Poul of the Shield, who
served with honor as Valen&#39;s right-hand man during the legendary War of
Light and the Ghoul Wars. It is the most prominent building in the
Valenon and considered one of the three holiest sites of the Church of
Law and Order.

The cathedral consists of a main chapel with numerous halls, chambers,
and smaller chapels located throughout. The interior is lavishly
decorated with stained glass windows, marble floors, bas-relief
carvings, elaborate sculptures, and gilded portals.

A famous mural known as the Victorious Son adorns the ceiling of the
main chapel. Painted by the renowned artist Stevan val Aerdon, this
mural depicts St. Valen leading his host to victory over the forces of
Chaos. The head of the church, known as the High Lawlord, dwells in the
upper levels of the cathedral, and his audience chamber balcony
overlooks St. Poul&#39;s Square.

## St. Poul&#39;s Square
This wide open square courtyard consists of a large fountain surrounded
by massive colonnades. A 10&#39; tall statue atop the fountain depicts St.
Poul holding his namesake shield. Thousands of dovecrows grace the
square. Perches on seven of the colonnades are reserved for the Holy
Serphala (see [[The Valenon]]) to sit and sing during certain services. St.  

Poul&#39;s Square is where the High Lawlord addresses the faithful on the
holiest days and festivals.

## Tomb of St. Poul
This sacred underground tomb is located directly beneath the cathedral&#39;s
main chapel and houses the remains of St. Poul of the Shield. The tomb
consists of a stone sarcophagus inside a vaulted chamber whose walls are
lined with statues, columns, and religious inscriptions. The
claw-scarred Shield of St. Poul hangs from two golden
chains affixed to the ceiling above the sarcophagus. Visitors are
permitted access to the tomb only on the holiest of days.

## Holy Aerie
This tall domed structure made of stone and glass houses the church&#39;s
flock of Holy Serphala. The serphala dwell in an open garden that takes
up most of the interior. Arched windows spaced evenly around the dome
may be opened to allow the serphala to fly in and out. The aerie is
tended by the clergy and is not open to the public.

## Catacombs of the Dead
The ancient tunnels beneath the Valenon are filled with secret
libraries, hidden vaults, and private tombs and burial chambers.

One of the most famous mass burial chamber is known as the Catacombs of
the Dead. Here, the remains of the faithful who choose to be interred by
the church are prepared and their bones mounted in the tunnel walls. In
this way, the deceased becomes a part of the church and loved ones
believe that prayers made at any shrine puts them in touch with
relatives who have passed.

A number of rumors suggest the catacombs occasionally succumb to undead
outbreaks, but this talk is fiercely denied by the church.

## Hall of Order and the Gardens of Law
The Hall of Order is an enormous library and museum filled with
religious statues, texts, and libraries. The hall is an historian&#39;s
paradise that shows a glimpse into Amalor&#39;s tumultuous past, although
some have criticized that these accounts were written from an entirely
religious perspective. The Hall of Order is extremely well organized and
is open and free to the public.

The Gardens of Law surround the Hall of Order. These gardens are a
collection of well-manicured gardens containing shrines to various
saints. Stone fences and tall hedgerows separate these gardens into
smaller courtyards that are designed to promote privacy and reflection.
These courtyards are filled with fountains, ponds, and religious
statues.

## Hall of Holy Studies
The Hall of Holy Studies is a serene dormitory, meeting hall, and
garden.

Twice per year, a select group of worshipers come here to pray, discuss
church doctrine, and learn the history of the church. This period of
study lasts for one month, during which time the church pays all of the
person&#39;s normal expenses (and that of his or her family&#39;s). The
curriculum is specially designed to determine whether or not any of
these handpicked worshipers have the potential to become one of the
Blessed.

At the end of the course, a special Son&#39;s Day ceremony is held and the
priests cast a *detect holy* spell on all worshipers in attendance.
Those found worthy are inducted into the clergy and trained to be a
spellcasting cleric.

## Valenon Vault
This secret underground vault lies beneath the Valenon and is guarded by
a faction of religious fanatics known as the White Crossguard. The
Valenon Vault supposedly holds the wealth of the Church of Law and
Order. Legends say that the vault also holds some of the church&#39;s
holiest relics, tomes, and darkest secrets, as well as evil magical
artifacts that were too powerful to destroy. Some say the vault is a
single fortified chamber, some say it consists of several chambers
hidden beneath the Valenon, while others say the vault is a fantasy that
does not even exist.


# THE VALENON INSIDE

&gt; &quot;Let this be the time to take a stand against the Darkness. To cast
&gt; down the worshipers of trees, demons, and other pagon gods so that
&gt; there can be peace on Amherth and goodwill to all men. *Avalen*.&quot;  
&gt; —High Lawlord Vernon Creighton

The Valenon is a sovereign city-state whose territory consists of a
walled enclave within the city of Dolmvay. The Valenon is a theocracy
ruled by the Church of Law and Order and the highest state functionaries
are all church clergymen. Valenon clergymen are responsible for
spreading church doctrine, conducting religious ceremonies, and
overseeing the needs of the worshipers in their charge. All clergymen
have rudimentary fighting skills and are expected to be familiar with
common weapons and armor.

## Organization
The Church of Law and Order organizes its territory into districts known
as calums. A calum may be centered around a neighborhood or several
neighborhoods (in a large city), a town, or a collection of towns or
villages. A number of different clergymen are assigned to oversee the
needs of worshipers in these calums.

## Deity Worship
The Church does not pay homage to a single benign deity. Instead, it
reveres the abstract power of Law and Order. At its core, this force
represents all that is holy, pure, and good in the world. Worshipers who
pray directly to the power of Law and Order often address it as &quot;The
Light&quot; or &quot;The White&quot; or &quot;The Holy&quot;. The church also venerates various
saints that many people are better able to identify with and pray to.
Praying to a saint is the same as praying to the forces of Law and
Order.

**Note:** DM&#39;s who prefer a more traditional pantheon of
different gods may simply change the &quot;forces of Law and Order&quot; to the
pantheon&#39;s dominant god, and change the various saints to gods and
demigods whose aspects are compatible.

## Symbology
The church’s symbol is the hilt of a sword. This represents the magical
Sword of Valen which he famously thrust into the ground, marking the
line that evil dare not cross. The Valenon&#39;s symbol is the sword hilt
flanked by two dovecrows. White, red, purple, gold, and black are the
church’s primary colors, and each has its own significance.

## Hierarchy
The clergymen of Law and Order spread church doctrine and oversee the
needs of the local calum, including conducting baptismal, marriage, and
funereal ceremonies. Clergymen take vows of celibacy and poverty—all
wealth collected through donations is considered the property of the
church.

Clergymen work hand in hand with the City Watch to maintain order, hunt
down fugitives, and enforce punishments. The clergy is divided into
ranks—High Lawlord, Lawlord, priest, friar, monk, and acolyte.

The High Lawlord is the supreme ruler of the Church of Law and Order and
the head of the Valenon city-state. A Lawlord is assigned to each of the
major cities (Dolmvay, Bay City, Irrlendom, etc.). Priests, friars,
monks, and acolytes are assigned to towns, city districts, or even large
neighborhoods. A number of other factions serve the Church of Law and
Order.

The various ranks of clergy can be distinguished by their appearance and
style of dress. Male clergymen keep their hair cut short or shorn
completely off. Monks and friars sometimes grow beards or goatees, but
priests and Lawlords seldom wear facial hair. Female members of the
clergy wear head coverings known as hasts and typically wear sleeved
robes and dresses that fall to the floor.

More elaborate raiment, including embroidered head coverings, robes,
sashes, shawls, and capes, as well as ornate chain mail armor is worn
during rituals and ceremonies. All clergymen wear holy symbols around
their necks at all times.

### High Lawlord
The High Lawlord is the supreme ruler of the Church of Law and Order and
the head of the Valenon city-state. The High Lawlord is responsible for
resolving doctrinal disputes, approving official appointments, and
crowning the hereditary Duke of Dolmvay.

The High Lawlord wears elaborate white robes with red hilts embroidered
on the hem. His medallion office is actually a hilt-shaped magical
necklace known as the Medallion of Law. His Staff of Order
is a magical staff made of ironwood, stained black and carved at the top
to resemble the hilt of a sword. During services, the High
Lawlord wears the mythical Helm of Valen and the Holy Mail and is said to be channeling the Power of Law.

The High Lawlord is never a spellcasting cleric. The High Lawlord is
commonly referred to as the &quot;Holy Father&quot;.

### Lawlord
A Lawlord is assigned to each of the major cities and is responsible for
ensuring that law and order are maintained throughout the local calums.
Lawlords are appointed by the High Lawlord. When a High Lawlord dies,
the Lawlords meet to elect a new High Lawlord from a pool of eligible
(non-spellcasting) priests. A Lawlord wears elaborate red robes with
white hilts embroidered on the hem. Almost all Lawlords are spellcasting
clerics. A Lawlord is commonly referred to as &quot;Honored Father&quot;.

### Priest
A priest oversees the needs of a local calum. A priest of Law and Order
wears a black cap, black pants, and a black tunic with white hilts
embroidered across the hem of the sleeves and neck. A priest is commonly
referred to as &quot;Father&quot;.

### Friar
A friar is assigned to a calum and given many of the same
responsibilities as a priest. Friars are required to spread church
doctrine, assist priests in rituals, and serve the poor and downtrodden.
A friar who is placed in charge of an abbey is known as an Abbot.

A friar is ordained as a minister and has the authority to perform most
church rituals and ceremonies. Friars commonly wear brown caps and
simple brown robes tied at the waist. A friar is not required to take a
vow of celibacy, however, many friars choose to live a chaste lifestyle
and go on to become priests. A friar is commonly referred to as &quot;Uncle&quot;.

### Monk
A monk lives a communal life in a church abbey or monastery. Monks take
vows of poverty and obedience. A monk’s daily life is spent in prayer,
study, and service to the church. Like friars, monks commonly wear brown
caps and simple brown robes tied at the waist. Many monks go on to
become friars or priests. A monk is commonly referred to as &quot;Brother&quot;.

### Sisters of Counsel
The Sisters of Counsel is the largest and most influential female sect
in the Church of Law and Order. They have many of the same trappings as
monks, and on some occasions a sister may become a friar or priestess
(commonly referred to as &quot;Aunt&quot; and &quot;Mother&quot;, respectively). A sister
who is placed in charge of an abbey is known as an Abbess.

Theoretically, a sister may one day become a Lawlord, but this has
happened only once in history with St. Lucilla the Kind. No female
member of the clergy has ever become the High Lawlord. The
highest-ranking Sisters of Counsel tend to be intelligent and wise, and
the High Lawlord often consults them on matters important to the faith.

### Acolyte
An acolyte is a newly accepted devotee of the church. Acolytes perform
menial tasks such as food preparation, housekeeping, husbandry, and
gardening. Acolytes also help monks, friars, and priests prepare for
daily services. An acolyte wears a simple gray robe belted at the waist.
An acolyte is commonly referred to as &quot;Son&quot; or &quot;Boy&quot;, regardless of the
acolyte&#39;s true age.

## The Blessed
The ability to cast cleric spells is not a requirement for becoming a
member of the clergy. Most of the church&#39;s highest-ranking members are
simply devout, but otherwise ordinary, men and women of the cloth.

Clergymen who can cast cleric spells are known as the Blessed (pr.
BLEH-sed). The Blessed are trained alongside clergymen, but are
encouraged to join factions such as the Lawguard, the Hiltamen, the
Lawbringers, the Order of Truth, or the White Crossguard in order to
better serve the needs of the church.

The Blessed are not required to take vows of celibacy, however, their
children are expected to be active in the church from a very young age.

### Spells of the Blessed
The Blessed are spellcasting clerics. However, in an effort to distance
clerical magic from that of a magic-user, cleric spells are referred to
as &quot;blessings&quot;. The church frowns upon any correlation between blessings
and sorcery.

## Church Doctrine
Church doctrine is simple: law and order must be maintained at all
costs. Without laws there can be no order. Without order there is only
chaos. Chaos brings pain, death, and wanton destruction. Therefore,
those who serve chaos must be eliminated. Neutrality serves neither
order nor chaos and is therefore unlawful. That which is unlawful must
become lawful or else it breeds chaos. Therefore, those who serve
neutrality must be redeemed. If they cannot be redeemed, they must be
destroyed.

The major tenets of the Church of Law and Order are largely based upon
the concepts of family, chivalry, self-sacrifice, redemption, and
service to the church. Those who rebel against this system often find
themselves ostracized from the rest of society. Listed below are the
primary concepts of church doctrine.

### Family

The church supports the traditional family unit where husbands provide
and protect, women care for the home, and children honor their parents.
This traditional model has been slowly unraveling over the past few
decades, much to the church&#39;s frustration.

### Chivalry
The church defines chivalry as a code of conduct whose supporters are
expected to uphold the law, defend the weak, and serve the church with
humility and grace. The chivalric code has been romanticized and adopted
by storytellers, minstrels, and poets all over Amherth.

### Self-Sacrifice
Valen sacrificed his own life to protect the people of Vay, so the
church believes it is only fitting that the people be ready to sacrifice
themselves as well. A father makes sacrifices for his family. A mother
makes sacrifices for her children. Anyone may be called upon to make
sacrifices for the church.

### Redemption
The church believes that even the most wicked villain can find their way
back to the true faith and become a force for good in the world. The
most famous example of this is the legendary St. Poul of the Shield, who
found redemption after being baptized in the Font of Law and Order. A subject who falters after being redeemed can expect stiff
punishments and little sympathy.

### Service to the Church
The church expects its worshipers to tithe regularly, honor the clergy,
and attend church services. Worshipers may also be called upon to devote
their time, labor, and skills to church-sponsored events. Service to the
church is considered a great honor.

## Afterlife
The church teaches that those who live Lawful and Orderly lives shall be
reborn in the mythical Kingdom of Law—a land of light, happiness, and
hope, where the Powers of Law and Order reign supreme and Chaos cannot
exist. In this Kingdom, faithful worshipers can expect to be reunited
with their loved ones where they continue to serve holy emissaries of
Law and be guided by their patron saints.

## Church Rituals

The Church of Law and Order and its worshipers conduct a number of
formal and informal rituals including baptism, prayer, sacrifice,
marriage, penance, and funerals.

### Baptism
The baptism ritual is one of the most important rituals in the Church of
Law and Order. Baptism symbolically washes away the evils of the world,
leaving the baptized a person of Law. Baptisms are usually conducted by
friars or priests. In Dolmvay, converts and newborn children are
traditionally baptized in the Font of Law and Order during the Son&#39;s Day
service. In other places, a sacred basin, pool, or other holy site is
used for baptisms.

### Prayer
The people of Dolmvay pray several times each day. These prayers may be
formal verses that are memorized and recited at specific times (such as
before an evening meal) or informal pleas made in times of need (such as
a whispered prayer for luck before attempting a task).

Prayers are made in general to the forces of Law and Order or are
directed at a particular saint. A person whose prayers have been
answered more than three times is sent to the Hall of Holy Studies to
determine whether or not the person is one of the Blessed.

### Sacrifice
It is believed that a sacrifice of some sort should accompany more
important prayers to increase the chances that the forces of Law and
Order take notice. These sacrifices are usually made with the assistance
of a clergyman. The most common types of sacrifices include animal
sacrifices, gifts of wealth or property, or the taking of solemn vows.

Animal sacrifices are butchered and the meat is shared with the clergy.
The sacrifice of magical beasts such as wyverns, demon boars, and
dragons are believed to be extremely potent. Gifts of wealth and
property are sent to the Valenon. Vows (no alcohol, silence, celibacy,
etc.) are typically made for a period of one year.

### Marriage
According to tradition, marriages are brokered by the head of a family,
sometimes with guidance of a local clergyman. If the bride has never
been married, her family is expected to provide a dowry and pay for the
ceremony. The size of this dowry and the extravagance of the ceremony
depends on the family&#39;s assets.

The ceremonial marriage ritual involves sacred vows of fidelity,
loyalty, and love between a man and woman. This is a lifelong bond that
may only be broken by the death of a spouse. The church does not
recognize divorce, however, a marriage may be annulled by a priest if it
is determined that a spouse has turned from the way of Law and refuses
to repent.

A widow or widower must take a vow of celibacy and wear black for a
grieving period of at least three months after the spouse&#39;s death. After
this time, the person is allowed to remarry with the full blessing of
the church. Marriage rituals may only be conducted by a priest.

### Penance
Those who deviate from church doctrine are held accountable for their
sins. Rebelliousness, deception, greed, impurity, adultery, theft,
sorcery, blasphemy, and murder all serve the forces of Chaos. Those
found guilty of such acts are not allowed to attend church services
until they repent and accept penance.

Penance takes many forms, depending on the severity of the infraction.
Minor forms of penance include recitation of special prayers, fasting,
fines, flogging, taking of vows, and public apologies made before the
entire calum.

Major forms of penance include taking vows of poverty, trial by ordeal
(torture), joining a Sainted Order, loss of an appendage, or undertaking
a pilgrimage. In some cases, such as an attack on a Lawlord, death may
be the only way to achieve absolution.

### Funeral
Funereal rituals involve a special ceremony spoken over the remains of a
loved one who has passed. The Church prefers burial to cremation. At the
family&#39;s request, the deceased may be interred in the Catacombs of the
Dead. Otherwise, the family is required to make their own burial
arrangements in accordance with accepted church practices. Funereal
rituals may only be conducted by a priest.

## Curative Magic
The church believes that there is a natural order to all things, even
pain and suffering. Therefore, curative magic (blessings) are only doled
out to non-clergymen at certain times in special ceremonies. At least
one Blessed clergyman must be present during these ceremonies.

The recipients of these spells must be active members of the Church of
Law and Order who contribute to the betterment of society. They may have
to meet other requirements in order to be eligible for healing. The
church believes that randomly healing the sick and injured would
encourage a disregard for safe practices and common sense and would only
serve to promote Chaos.

The church does not accept direct monetary payment for curative magic,
however, the faithful are expected to tithe regularly, so payment is
implied. This has caused friction between the church and a number of
impious and/or miserly nobles and merchants who have been refused
magical healing until they accept penance.

Unscrupulous clergymen sometimes cast healing spells in exchange for
pay, but those caught doing so are subject to severe punishments.
Adventuring clerics are authorized to heal their companions as needed,
but are expected to adhere to church doctrine when dealing with others
of the faith.

### Cure Light Wounds
*Cure light wounds* spells may be cast on those in need during the Son&#39;s
Day service at the end of each week. A Blessed clergyman may also decide
to bestow healing on worshipers who are injured while actively
furthering the cause of Law and Order (such as the City Watch or on
villagers facing a ruk invasion).

### Cure Serious Wounds and Cure Critical Wounds
These spells may only be cast on church members during services that
occur on the last Son&#39;s Day of the month. The subject of a *cure serious
wounds* or *cure critical wounds* spell is expected to serve the church
in some capacity for at least one month.

For example, a baker may be called upon to bake goods for church
functions, a blacksmith may be required to shoe Hiltamen horses, while
an adventurer may have to escort church dignitaries, guard sacred sites,
or undertake quests on behalf of the church.

**Cure Blindness, Cure Disease, Heal, Neutralize Poison, Regeneration,
Remove Curse, Restoration**

Spells such as *cure blindness, cure disease, heal, neutralize poison,
regeneration, remove curse,* or *restoration* may be cast at any time on
the faithful, but requires special consultation by the clergy.

The recipient of the spell must be an active and respected member of the
church. He must possess an exceptional skill (such as adventuring) or be
in a position where his influence can be used to benefit the church in
some way (such as a powerful noble or high-ranking guildsman). The
recipient must agree to serve the church in some capacity for at least
one year, as outlined above.

Many who are cured in this manner are so grateful to the church that
they choose to renounce their past lives and become clergymen
(acolytes).

### Raising the Dead
As with healing, the church believes that death is part of the natural
order. Therefore, a *raise dead* or *resurrection* spell is only cast in
the most extreme circumstances. The subject to be raised or resurrected
must meet the following additional criteria:

The person must be an active member of the Church of Law and
Order—followers of false gods and evil religions are not entitled to the
church&#39;s blessings.

The person must have died while upholding the tenets of the Church of
Law and Order. The person may have been on a quest for the church or may
simply have died while undertaking a Lawful adventure.

The person must be known for at least five significant Lawful deeds. In
game terms this means the person must be at least 7th level or higher.
It is assumed that an active member of the church who is known for his
Lawful adventures is an asset to the church who deserves special
consideration.

## History of St. Valen of Vay
Valen of Vay was a mythical hero of the Old World whose origins have
been lost to time. He was known as the Son of Sons and many religious
scholars believe he was a descendant of a very old and powerful race of
men known only as the Ancients.

Valen is said to be a Champion of Law and Order and was named the First
Sword of the Great City of Vay. Valen underwent many trials and
tribulations in order to overcome the forces of Chaos who constantly
sought to corrupt him. He was said to be a just and compassionate man
who was fair in his dealings with all folk. Valen&#39;s life story has been
immortalized in a number of epic stories, songs, and poems. Some of his
most famous adventures include the War of the Iron Dragons, the
Redemption of St. Poul, the Temptations of the Nine, the War of Light,
and the Great Sacrifice.

The War of the Iron Dragons tells of a time when the Great City of Vay
was attacked by terrible iron golems from the Wastelands of Aal.
According to legends, Vay was doomed to fall until the heroic Valen
marshaled the city&#39;s defenses and repelled the assault. After the
battle, Valen was named First Sword of Vay and given command of the
city&#39;s armies.

The Redemption of St. Poul showcases Valen&#39;s compassion and ability to
forgive. After being named First Sword, Valen begins a campaign to
establish law and order beyond the walls of the Great City of Vay. One
by one, Valen crushes the gangs of pirates and brigands who prey on
travelers. The stragglers regroup under the leadership of a brigand
chieftain named Poul the Butcher. Poul challenges Valen to single combat
and Valen defeats the Butcher in an epic duel. Rather than kill Poul,
however, Valen gives him the chance to convert to the cause of Law and
Order. Poul accepts and after his baptism in the sacred Font of Law and
Order (see below) goes on to become Valen&#39;s right-hand man.

In the Temptations of the Nine, Valen is captured by an evil sorceress
named Jessical the Burner, leader of an ancient cabal of witches known
as the Nine from Across the Water. During his imprisonment, Valen is
subjected to all manner of vile sorceries, tortures, and temptations,
but his faith never wavers. Valen eventually escapes and slays his
captors, teaching the faithful that good always overcomes wickedness and
evil.

The War of Light began soon after the fall of the Great City of Mor.
Drunk from their conquest of Mor, forces of the Halfruk Lord sought to
test Vay&#39;s resolve by raiding its outlying farms and settlements. Valen
responded quickly, and the disciplined armies of Vay easily routed the
disorganized raiders. As the Halfruk Lord&#39;s armies fled, Valen thrust
his great sword into the rocky ground and declared that no creature of
evil would cross this line and live. This symbolic act was adopted by
the Church of Law and Order, and the image of Valen&#39;s sword hilt has
become one of its central and most iconic images.

The Great Sacrifice of Valen marked the end of a dark period in Vay&#39;s
history known as the Ghoul Wars. The Ghoul Wars began when an undead
lord from the northlands known as the Ghoul King Lorrgan Makaar marched
on the Great City of Vay with an army of ghouls. Valen led his forces
against the undead host and the two armies traded a series of victories
and defeats. Valen realized that the ghoul army grew larger with every
battle and knew he could not win the war through force of arms alone.

Valen challenged Lorrgan Makaar to single combat and the arrogant Ghoul
King accepted. The two fought an epic duel in the mountain range that
would one day come to be known as the Peaks of Valen. According to
legends, the Ghoul King was on the brink of defeat when he called forth
evil magic to cripple Valen. St. Poul came to Valen&#39;s defense and warded
off the Ghoul King&#39;s attacks, allowing Valen to call upon the forces of
Law and Order to protect the Great City of Vay.

Valen died in a great flash of light, the Ghoul King was spectacularly
defeated, and his ghoul army was forever sealed in the lands to the
north.\*

## Holy Relics
The following holy relics are sacred to the Church of Law and Order.
These items may contain additional powers that can be unlocked with
certain command words, at certain times, or by certain people, at the
DM&#39;s discretion

### The Guiding Light
After the Great Sacrifice, St. Poul of the Shield returned to the Great
City of Vay and took a vow of silence. In a series of handwritten
scrolls, the grieving St. Poul compiled a firsthand account of all of
Valen&#39;s words and deeds. These scrolls were later copied by other
clergymen who added historical information, church doctrine, brief
anecdotes, and common parallels to everyday life in a collection of
documents that would come to be known as *The* *Guiding Light*. *The*
*Guiding Light* is a massively popular text that can be found in nearly
every home.

### Shield of St. Poul
The Shield of St. Pool is a dented and claw-scored shield that belonged
to the legendary St. Poul of the Shield. The Shield functions normally
as a *shield+1*. In the hands of a Lawful character, the shield function
as a *shield+3*, gives its bearer *protection from normal missiles*, and
projects a *protection from evil 10&#39; radius*.

### Helm of Valen

The iconic Helm of Valen is a full helm made of shining steel. The Helm
provides a magical +2 bonus to the wearer&#39;s Armor Class. The wearer of
the Helm receives the benefits of a *true seeing* spell. In addition,
the wearer may cast *know alignment, detect lie*, and *tongues* at will.
These powers only work for a wearer of Lawful alignment. Any person of
Neutral or Chaotic alignment who dons the helm must make a saving throw
vs. death magic or be instantly disintegrated. The Helm of Valen is
stored in the Cathedral of St. Poul and is worn only by the High
Lawlord.

### Holy Mail

The Holy Mail is an ornate suit of *chain mail+3* that is worn by the
High Lawlord during ceremonies. The Holy Mail grants its wearer
*protection from normal missiles*.

### Medallion of Law

The Medallion of Law is a hilt-shaped medallion that grants the wearer
85% magic resistance and makes him immune to mind-affecting spells such
as *charm person* and *ESP*. The Medallion of Law is a sacred artifact
that is worn by the High Lawlord at all times.

### Staff of Order

The Staff of Order is a magical staff made of ironwood, dyed black and
carved at the top to resemble the hilt of a sword. It functions as a
*quarterstaff +3*. In the hands of a Lawful character, the staff can
produce the following spell-like effects three times per day as if cast
by a 12th level cleric: *command, spiritual weapon, striking, flame
strike, blade barrier, earthquake*. The Staff of Order is a sacred
artifact that is only carried by the High Lawlord.

### The Font of Law and Order

This magical fountain is blessed by the forces of Law and Order. It was
blessed by the legendary St. Valen of Vay and once produced a
never-ending supply of holy water. The water acted as a *cure light
wounds* spell to those it touched. The font was also used for
christenings, baptisms, and other religious ceremonies.

A truth known only to a few is that the font&#39;s waters instantly changed
the alignment of anyone baptized in it to Lawful. The font dried up
shortly after Valen&#39;s death in the Great Sacrifice. It no longer
possesses any magical properties, although it is still used for
religious ceremonies. The Font of Law and Order is located inside the
Cathedral of St. Poul of the Shield.

# DISTRICT OF COMMONS
&gt; &quot;Hear ye! Hear ye! Now is to tell of the Brotherhood of Wrath, a tale
&gt; of treachery and vile deeds that comes all the way from Irrlendom!&quot;  
&gt; —City Crier Margaret Stelson

**Location:** North of the Market District bordering the River District.

**Neighborhoods:** Middle-class with some lower-class.

**Common Businesses:** Armorers, bakers, blacksmiths, butchers,
cobblers, farmers, florists, hostlers, inns, taverns.

**Watch Presence:** Moderate (Day); Low (Night)

**Things to Remember:** The District of Commons is the oldest district
in Dolmvay with many of its stone buildings, grassy parks, and ancient
statues dating back to the time of Vay. It is now primarily a
middle-class residential and shop district inhabited by craftsmen,
merchants, soldiers, and retired adventurers.

## Inn of the Gray Worm
The Inn of the Gray Worm caters mainly to adventurers and sellswords.
The first floor contains a common taproom, several small meeting rooms,
kitchens, with stables out back and a cellar below. The second floor
contains private sleeping chambers.

A collection of large jagged teeth are mounted on a plaque behind the
bar and the proprietor, Jak Brindle, swears they were taken from a gray
worm he killed during his former adventuring career. The Inn of the Gray
Worm serves Good quality meals.

## The Old Brewery
This former guildworks brewery has been abandoned for decades and has
become a local eyesore. It contains trash, debris, crumbling vats,
rotting barrels, and other brewing equipment. The building has served as
home for orphans, beggars, thieves, feral dogs, and even the occasional
monster. The City Watch (or an intrepid band of adventurers) is often
called in to address the citizens&#39; complaints.

## Grathane&#39;s Armory
This famous armorer&#39;s shop is owned and operated by the burly Marlon
Grathane. The first floor contains a display room in the front with an
open forge in the rear and a cellar below. Grathane and his family live
in a modest home located directly across the street. Grathane&#39;s
apprentices can build, mend, and repair armor at the normal rates.

Grathane himself can be commissioned to create armor that is far
superior to normal armor, at triple the normal cost. This armor
temporarily lowers the character&#39;s Armor Class by an additional -1. This
armor loses its bonus after sustaining a number of hits equal to 10 -
(armor&#39;s normal AC).

For example, a suit of chain mail fashioned by Grathane is treated as AC
4 until it suffers 5 successful strikes (10 - 5), after which time it reverts to AC 5. The armor can be restored at a price equal to the
original cost of a normal suit of armor of that type.

## Eternal Flame of St. Margaret of Calesto
St. Margaret of Calesto is a patron saint of the poor and downtrodden.
This shrine is located in a small courtyard and consists of a pedestal
from which an eternal fire magically burns. Those seeking to ward off
poverty and economic misfortune come here to leave items of clothing,
blankets, food, and other offerings around the shrine. The poor and less
fortunate are encouraged to say a prayer of thanks and take these items.

During the colder months, St. Margaret&#39;s fires can be seen burning in
trash bins throughout many of Dolmvay&#39;s back alleys, keeping orphans and
beggars warm. It is commonly believed that those who attempt to douse
these fires tend to suffer hardships in the near future.

## Trident Park
This grassy lawn is one of several local parks lined with paths and
dotted with statues and fountains. It is a favorite site of street
performers and festivals. The park draws its name from a ring of three
tall standing stones that lie at its center. These stones are rumored to
have both magical and religious significance.

## District of Commons Factions
The following factions may be encountered in the District of Commons.

### City Crier&#39;s Guild
Criers from the City Crier&#39;s Guild are paid to shout announcements from
&quot;crier&#39;s blocks&quot; in public forums such as open markets, large taverns,
and grassy parks. Announcements include recent events, new decrees, and
the latest deeds of famous adventuring companies. In this way, the
common people of Dolmvay stay informed about important happenings in
other parts of the city.

Criers can expect free meals and drink with locals who wish to gossip
after particularly interesting announcements. Wealthy citizens sometimes
tip criers in order to encourage them to shout the more important
announcements in their neighborhoods first. The City Crier&#39;s Guild
standard is a pair of crossed trumpets.

## District of Commons NPCs of Note
The following NPCs may be encountered in the District of Commons.

### Vicious Licious
The Vicious Licious are a small street-level broklaw whose territory is
based around the Black Spire Neighborhood. The Vicious Licious
specializes in violent crimes. They operate out of a rough brothel named
the Innkeeper&#39;s Gronted Daughter. The Vicious Licious are led by its
founder, a veteran street thug named Snake Marton. Their standard is a
tongue licking a knife blade.

### Mother Aleese the Silver Lady of Battle
Mother Aleese is a middle-aged priestess of St. Johanna the Maiden of
Battle. She is a former Lawbringer who decided to retire from
adventuring after being drained almost to death by a pack of wights. Her
calum is located in a particularly nasty section of the District of
Commons.

Mother Aleese has had several run-ins with local broklaw gangs who were
harassing her worshipers. Her latest troubles ended when she donned her
weapons and armor, kicked in the front door of a broklaw stronghold, and
began cracking skulls. Since then, the locals have given her the
nickname the Silver Lady of Battle, and the broklaws have left her
people alone.

**Mother Aleese:** AL L; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 12 (Dex) or 3 (chain mail +

only picked up a sword to defend himself during a night raid by ruks.

Jak is friendly and talkative and offers to share his knowledge of the
land, monsters, magic, etc. with new adventuring companies. Any
information he passes on, however, is bound to be flawed.

Storen carries his laboratory in several portable chests and rarely
stays at one inn for long periods of time. Storen has many contacts
among local sages and magic-users. He enjoys experimenting with potions
and brews, and there is a 20% chance that one of his batches causes a
strange side effect in the imbiber. Storen keeps shoddy notes, however,
and his recipes can seldom be intentionally replicated.

1.  Skin turns dark blue for 1d4 turns.  
2.  Instantly fall asleep as per a *sleep* spell.

city-state of Westport. Cadriel was exiled from Westport after
organizing a failed coup, along with several other powerful noble houses
who sought to install Cadriel as their emperor. He fled to Dolmvay and
is now seeking help to restore his family name and reclaim what he feels
is his birthright.

Cadriel carries an intelligent magical sword named the Moon Blade. The
sword normally acts as a *+2 longsword* that can *detect magic* once per
day. During the time of the new moon, it acts as a *+1 longsword* and
loses its ability to *detect magic*. During the time of the full moon,
it acts as a *+3 longsword* and grants its wielder *ESP* (as per the
spell), three times per day.

Cadriel is currently looking to hire mercenaries and adventurers to help

full beard. Amelrik is cautious and chooses his words and his friends
carefully. He seldom speaks about his past, but rumors suggest he was
once a trusted member of the former Duke&#39;s Iron Wolves. Amelrik is

### Ragstad Alemaker

Ragstad is a stocky half-elf who was born and raised in a small woodland
village just south of Irrlendom. He has brown hair and piercing
blue-green eyes. Ragstad is the bastard son of a Vanhurr elf warrior who
seduced his naïve mother before disappearing back into the wilds.
Ragstad grows his hair long to cover his ears and attempts to hide his
elven ancestry.

Ragstad was raised by his mother, his grandfather (an accomplished
brewer who taught him the family trade), and a kindly magic-user named
Elgrim the Sage who took special interest in him.

With the wizard&#39;s guidance, Ragstad began to study the art of magic. He
honed his fighting and stealth skills on missions to scout out nearby
ruins, collect magical ingredients, and carry messages to and from the
wizard&#39;s allies. It was during this time that Ragstad first visited the
City of Dolmvay and immediately fell in love with the great, urban
sprawl.

Elgrim the Sage abruptly disappeared while Ragstad was away and Ragstad
later learned that the wizard had been killed while accompanying a war
party of Vanhurr elves on an ill-fated raid into the Wastelands of Aal.
The death of Ragstad&#39;s mentor struck him hard. Needing a change of
scenery, he bid goodbye to his mother and grandfather and returned to
the City of Dolmvay to make his fortune.

Ragstad is a member of the Dolmvay Adventurer&#39;s Guild, and often hires
himself out as an investigator or finder of lost items (and people). He
presents himself as a fighter and prefers the role of party fighter or
thief, only relying on magic as a last resort. His skill as a brewer
makes him welcome in almost any company. He also whittles or crafts
small toys in his spare time to give away to children.

Ragstad currently lives in a small apartment in the River District with
his familiar, an orange striped tomcat named Sabi.

**Ragstad Alemaker:** AL L; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 17 (leather armor + *ring

### Willow Greer the Mushroom Sage

Willow is a short, friendly woman with green eyes and messy brown hair.
She wears a mud-stained cloak with mushrooms embroidered into the hem
and carries a walking stick decorated with orange and yellow fungi near
the top.

Willow is a mushroom scholar and enthusiast whose obsession began with a
study of how decay nourishes life. Willow cultivates and breeds
mushrooms for culinary and alchemical purposes and always has a box full
of specimens to show interested visitors. Willow delights in talking
about mushrooms to anyone who will listen.

Willow lives in a natural cave hidden deep in the Dolmvay sewers. This
cave is filled with normal- and giant-sized fungi, one of which is a
toadstool large enough to serve as her cottage. Willow&#39;s home is filled
with a bizarre collection of fungi in many different states of growth
(occasionally growing on decaying corpses). A colony of giant ants serve
as her guards. These ants have been infected with a special type of
fungus that makes them obey Willow&#39;s simple commands.

Willow takes great care when traveling to and from her cave in order to
keep the location of her home a secret. When above ground, she can most
often be found near the River District.

**Willow Greer:** treat as 0-level human with Wis 17, AC 9, hp 4, dagger
(Dmg 1d4), and *1d6 random* *potions*.

### Ermloch the Alchemist

Ermloch is a tall, gaunt man with short unkempt hair and dark shadows
around his eyes that make him look permanently hung over. Ermloch wears
threadbare clothing and dresses in haphazard fashion, making him seem
absentminded to some. He treats his dramatic bouts of sniffling and
wheezing with a homemade herbal tonic made from sweet lotus extract. In
reality, he simply enjoys the taste and effects of the remedy, and often
exaggerates the extent of his symptoms.

Ermloch is a student of arcane lore and a skilled alchemist who once
contended for the headmaster position of the Dolmvay Alchemist&#39;s Guild.
Ermloch&#39;s faction was disgraced after he misjudged a measurement during
an alchemical trial between prospective masters. This mistake caused an
explosion that consumed part of the guild house and led to a series of
devastating fires on what came to be known as the Night of the Green
Flames. Ermloch believes (rightly) that his ingredients were sabotaged
by one of his rivals, but has never been able to determine which one.

Ermloch is wealthy from a successful adventuring career, where his
knowledge of history and ability to conduct research helped his party
uncover several unguarded treasure troves. He currently presents himself
as an unassuming wine merchant who owns A Taste of Amherth vintner&#39;s
shop. His cellar contains secret entrances to an extensive library and
laboratory that he still uses to conduct research.

Ermloch is always willing to trade knowledge and recipes with sages and
adventurers. There is very little that Ermloch cannot discover if given
enough time to conduct research.

**Ermloch the Alchemist:** AL L; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 9; MU5; hp 14; \#AT

### Watchman Dextan &quot;Dex&quot; Relbury

Dex Relbury is a large, friendly Watchman who works the River District.
Dex cannot stand drunks and is known for his ability to (painfully)
restore order during drunken tavern brawls. His favorite tactic is to
throw unruly drunkards into the river.

Dex is currently investigating a smuggling ring led by a broklaw gang
named the River Jumps. The River Jumps are known to hang from
Dolmsbridge at night, drop onto unsuspecting boats as they pass
underneath, and quickly unload cargo onto waiting skiffs and barges. Dex
has arrested several members of the River Jumps and the rest are
planning to ambush him while he makes his rounds.

**Dextan &quot;Dex&quot; Relbury**: treat as 0-level human with Str 16, AC 5
(chain mail), hp 3, spear (Dmg 1d6+2), long sword (Dmg 1d8+2), dagger

# DISTRICT OF SCHOLARS
&gt; &quot;The River divides. As surely as the clothes upon our backs, the
&gt; wealth inside our purses, and the weight of our family names. We must
&gt; all learn to cross these rivers one day.&quot;  
&gt; —Vinthus Tralento

**Location:** Northernmost end of the South Ward.

**Neighborhoods:** Middle-class with some upper-class.

**Common Businesses:** Alchemists, artists, bookbinders, churches,
copyists, glassblowers, healers, inns, mapmakers, scholars, theaters,
taverns.

**Watch Presence:** Moderate (Day); Low (Night)

**Things to Remember:** The District of Scholars is one of the newer
city districts. It is funded by the wealthy, and most of its buildings
are made of stone and decorated with murals and bas-relief carvings.

The district is home to a number of private libraries, theaters, art
galleries, and houses of academia, that attract all manner of sages,
scholars, artists, poets, and other men of higher learning. A number of
small parks and gardens are also scattered throughout.

Think philosophers holding class in public squares, men and women
hurrying back and forth with bundles of scrolls, and street side poets
stopping to transcribe an inspired verse.

## Gosling Theater
This three-story theater is famous for its social, political, and even
religious satires. These performances have come under fire in the past
from angry nobles and religious officials, but the theater has the full
support of the public and has been able to weather all controversies.
The theater&#39;s mascot, known as &quot;Gozzy the Goose&quot;, is a brash performer
named Devan Bradberry who dresses as a goose and gets into mischief in
different parts of the city.

## House of Albritton
This well-kept tavern/inn is frequented by a younger crowd of scholars,
minstrels, and students. The first floor contains an open taproom,
kitchens, and several small private meeting chambers. The second floor
contains private sleeping chambers. The House of Albritton serves Good
quality meals. The tavern hosts open stage nights where aspiring
minstrels and poets can recite their works and be judged by their peers.

## Tower of Winds
This innocuous-looking four-story building belongs to a group of
scholars known as the Society of Winds whose stated mission is to
measure the strength of air circulation in various parts of the city
during different times of the day, month, and year.

The first floor contains private sitting rooms, a dining room, kitchens,
and a display room containing fans, pinwheels, flags, and sails from all
over Amherth. The second and third floors contain private members&#39;
chambers. The fourth floor houses the society&#39;s elderly headmaster,
Bryan Sturlaker.

The Society of Winds is actually a front for the White Wizard&#39;s Guild of
Dolmvay (see below) with hidden laboratories and secret libraries
located in an extensive complex beneath the tower.

## Dyson&#39;s Delve
This cramped basement shop is packed with book-lined shelves, stacks of
old scrolls, map collections, regional atlases, adventure logs, and
random scribblings. A secret entrance to Dolmvay&#39;s sewers is believed to
be hidden behind the clutter. Various maps can be purchased from Dyson
the Cartographer who sleeps on a pallet in a dark corner of the room and
almost never leaves the shop.

## Cathedral of St. Mincival the Grand
St. Mincival was a charming performer who was known for his skill with a
lute, his bravery, and his ability to see the kindness and beauty in all
men. The Cathedral of St. Mincival is a converted temple of the Love
Goddess Jesil that was built on the site long ago. It consists of a
rectangular stone hall whose roof is supported by stone columns. Various
entertainers perform in front of the church and in the park across the
street in the hopes of receiving donations or patronage.

## Theater of Bertollo
The Theater of Bertollo is an open amphitheater built upon a grassy
hill. The theater hosts several festivals throughout the year as well as
biweekly plays, acrobat shows, and other performances. The Theater of
Bertollo was the site of a gruesome massacre when a rogue adventuring
company named the Talons Three beheaded and staked the members of a
popular acting troupe called the Night Wives during one of their more
risque performances. The Talons Three then fled the city and have not
been seen since.

## Library of Torbett
Master Torus Torbett was an eccentric historian who spent much of his
life acquiring books, copying scrolls, and recording ancient legends
down on paper. After his death, he left instructions that his collection
be open to the public and that it remain in a disorganized state.

The library is a cramped collection of shelves, tables, and private
rooms spread throughout two floors above ground, with an extensive
cellar below that is rumored to contain secret hidden chambers. It is
frequented mainly by scholars, curious adventurers, and agents of the
church who occasionally comb through the haphazard mass of written works
in search of heretical documents.

## Halls of Learning
The Halls of Learning are a private collection of named buildings where
various subjects and fields of study are taught and discussed. The halls
are located close to the Library of Torbett in what many consider to be
the Academic Quarter.

A recent petition started by several prominent scholars is asking for
the city treasury to back funding for a consolidated university centered
around the Halls of Learning, but the proposal has yet to be brought
before the Duke.

## Tenkar&#39;s Tavern
Tenkar&#39;s Tavern is a well-kept tavern that is frequented mainly by
scholars, adventurers, and reputable demihumans. The Tavern has become a
haven for amateur creative types, with nightly songs, stories, games,
giveaways, and poetry readings being common forms of live entertainment.

The first floor contains an open taproom, kitchens, and several private
meeting rooms, with a stable out back and a cellar below. Tenkar&#39;s
Tavern serves Good quality meals. It is owned and operated by a
red-bearded dwarf named Tenkar the Barkeep who resides in an apartment
above the tavern.

## District of Scholars NPCs of Note
The following NPCs may be encountered in the District of Scholars.

### Society of Winds
The Society of Winds is a scholarly guild whose stated mission is to
measure the strength of air circulation in various parts of the city
during different times of the day, month, and year. The Society of Winds
is actually a front for the White Wizard&#39;s Guild of Dolmvay. These
wizards operate in secret to avoid persecution by the citizens and the
Church of Law and Order. The Society&#39;s headquarters is based in the
Tower of Winds and their standard is a rooftop weathervane.

## District of Scholars Factions
The following factions may be encountered in the District of Scholars.

### Windmaster Bryan Sturlaker
Windmaster Bryan Sturlaker is the venerable leader of the Dolmvay White
Wizard&#39;s Guild. Master Bryan pretends to be a doddering old scholar, but
is in fact a dynamic individual who has dedicated his life to protecting
the citizens of Dolmvay from magical threats.

Master Bryan works closely with his former pupil, the Lady Elena vala
Dolm, to ensure the Duke and the city remain safe. He recently fought
the evil wizard Barrugal the Infamous to a draw in the ruins of Bearmont
Tower, and has been recovering from his injuries ever since. Master
Bryan is still trying to determine what business the Infamous One had in
the City of Dolmvay, and believes it had something to do with the
history of a minor saint named Aleena.

### Society of the Swan
The Society of the Swan is a group of young nobles and privileged youths
who identify with the ancient noble houses of Mor. Society members feel
the line of Dolm are usurpers that must be overthrown.

The Society seeks to undermine the government through acts of civil
disobedience, inventing irreverent slogans and phrases, spreading false
rumors, and organizing public demonstrations in order to promote their
anti-authoritarian agenda. A few of its more radical members have
actually begun plotting acts of violence against agents of the Duke and
the Church of Law and Order. The Society of the Swan&#39;s standard is a
white swan. Their leader is the radical Devan Bradberry.

### Devan Bradberry
Davol Bitterbrook was a young street performer who was arrested for
fomenting unrest. Davol escaped captivity and assumed a new identity as
Devan Bradberry, a performer who is best known for his role as &quot;Gozzy
the Goose&quot;, the irreverent mascot of the Gosling Theater.

Davol is an anarchist who despises the church, the nobility, and the
government. Under the guise of Gozzy, Davol is able to mock the
establishment without fear of reprisal. Davol has started an anarchist
movement known as the Society of the Swan which is slowly gaining
traction, mainly amongst privileged youths seeking a diversion.

pulled back into a ponytail. She is an accomplished scout and guide who
can sometimes be overconfident in her fighting ability. Caby is kind at
heart and protective of those in need. She left her wandering clan
several years ago after almost causing the death of a longtime friend
and has not seen her family since.

Caby has been on a number of adventures since leaving her clan. She is
best known for slaying the Poison Spear gobruk king Viper Larkes with an
arrow to the throat. She also helped end the Plague of Rotham by slaying
the wererat responsible for the spread of disease throughout the town,

assist a calum priest in the District of Scholars. Brother Dennos is a

bookbinder and copyist with an artistic flair. He enjoys transcribing
copies of *The Guiding Light* and adding (sometimes irreverent) cartoons
into the margins.

**Brother Dennos Jackson:** treat as 0-level human with Int 13, AC 9, hp
2, dagger (Dmg 1d4).

### Brianna of Kingsgarden

years as a City Watchman in the Underguild where he still has many
contacts, most notably Dargan &quot;the Dwarf&quot; Anvilon.

Tenkar joined an adventuring company in order to travel, but eventually
returned to Dolmvay and opened Tenkar&#39;s Tavern in the more racially
tolerant District of Scholars. Tenkar is known for his kindness and
generosity, however, he still enjoys a good barroom brawl.

Tenkar hates criminals. He recently discovered a secret entrance to his
cellar and knows that someone has been using it to sample his choicest
wines and beers. Tenkar is currently making plans to apprehend the thief
and teach him a lesson.

### Dyson the Cartographer
Dyson is an overweight human mapmaker with two very different eyes—one
is large and can see great distances while the other is smaller and
useful for fine details. Dyson&#39;s back is bent from years of poring over
parchment and lack of exercise. He typically wears ratty, ink-stained
robes and plain sandals.

Dyson moved into his basement apartment before he became successful and
cannot be bothered to find better accommodations now that he has
established himself. Dyson seldom leaves his home, however, his maps
tend to be frighteningly accurate.

Dyson is well known to members of the Adventurer&#39;s Guild and can expect
favors and protection from almost any adventurer in Dolmvay. Adventuring
companies often pick through Dyson&#39;s shop in search of treasure maps or
maps of ancient ruins (before they became ruins). Dyson is usually more
than willing to trade his maps for either new maps or recent adventure
journals.

Over the past few months, Dyson has been entering a strange trance and
drawing lines and symbols on his body. He keeps these symbols hidden by
clothing as he tries to determine their meaning. The lines and symbols
are actually a map of gateways to other worlds.

**Dyson the Cartographer:** treat as 0-level human with Dex 16, AC 7
(Dex), hp 3, dagger (Dmg 1d4), pencils and sketchbook, pouch full of
Meschil root, 2d6 gp, 1d8 sp, and 2d4 cp.

### Vinthus Tralento
The aging Vinthus is an esteemed scholar and philosopher from
Guildeland. Vinthus has long been opposed to hereditary titles and
believes that every man should be valued based upon his worth to society
rather than what family he was lucky enough to have been born into.

Vinthus has been convicted of disturbing the peace on several occasions.
One of his most famous and inflammatory speeches, *The Birthright
Hypocrisy*, is believed to have been responsible for a day of civil
unrest known as the March of the Commons. This protest started in the
City Center District and soon became a riot that spilled into the
District of Nobles before the Halstead City Watch restored order in a
brutal crackdown.

**Vinthus Tralento:** treat as 0-level human with Int 15, Wis 17, Cha
15, AC 9, hp 3, dagger (Dmg 1d4), and 1d4 cp.

hunting down rogue magic-users. He is an unassuming man with a keen mind
and a fierce devotion to the people and the church. Father Willem has

of Scholars. Posing as a religious sage named Waldan Sellers, he has
moved into a small apartment near the Theater of Bertollo in order to
investigate.

# PALATIAL DISTRICT
&gt; &quot;Make way! Make way for the Duke!&quot;  
&gt; —Iron Wolf entourage

**Location:** Northwest corner of the city on the banks of the Dolm
River.

**Neighborhoods:** Upper-class with some middle-class.

**Common Businesses:** Inns, taverns.

**Watch Presence:** High (Day); Moderate (Night)

**Things to Remember:** The Palatial District is home to the Duke and
his family as well as the wealthiest nobles and royal ambassadors from
other realms. It is the most heavily guarded area of the city. Think
military patrols, foreign retinues, and royal entourages.

## Ducal Docks
These heavily guarded docks double as a royal shipyard and are used only
for official ducal business. The docks are named after various royal
titles (Earlsdock, Dukesdock, Kingsdock, etc.) and each dock bears royal
heraldry. The docks lie about 10&#39; to 20&#39; below street level and are
accessed by stone staircases that hug the river walls. The Duke&#39;s
personal ship, the *Star of Dolm*, is moored here along with a number of
other royal and military vessels.

## Ducal Palace
The Ducal Palace lies at the center of a sprawling walled compound known
as the Palatial District. The palace is an impressive structure marked
by tall spires, fluttering banners, crenellated battlements, and open
courtyards. The throne room and lower levels of the palace are open to
the public throughout the day. The Duke and his family dwell in private
chambers located in the upper levels.

## Royal Dungeons
The Royal Dungeons lie deep beneath the Ducal Palace. They are a dismal
place that consist of many cells, holding areas, and torture chambers,
with the most vile criminals being housed in the lowermost levels. In
times past, the dungeon guards were recruited from the cruelest and most
sadistic jailers in the land, and the few prisoners lucky enough to be
released seldom left with their minds and/or bodies intact. A secret
passage connecting the dungeons to the sewers is rumored to exist.

## Ducal Square
The Ducal Square is an open courtyard inside the palace compound where
the Duke can address his loyal subjects. During festival times, citizens
fill the square, entertainers (bards, jugglers, puppeteers, etc.) vie
for attention, and vendors hawk their wares from the surrounding
arcades. The square has been the site of several high-profile public
executions over the years.

## Chapel of St. Valen
The Chapel of St. Valen is located adjacent to the Ducal Palace. It is
the second largest church in the city (see the Cathedral of St. Poul,
pg. 48) and its lower levels are said to connect to the ancient warrens
beneath the Son of Sons monument. The chapel is famous for
its stained glass windows which depict the heroic Valen of Vay and his
victories over the war machines of Aal to the west and the undead
kingdom of Makaar Mor to the north.

## Ambassador Quarter 
This quarter is home to foreign human ambassadors and their retinues as
well as contingents of elves and dwarves from the nearby kingdoms of
Vanhurr and Gundamark. The shops and taverns here are high-end
establishments with strict standards for etiquette and dress.

The Ambassador Quarter is thick with spying and intrigue. Although open
conflict is forbidden, honor duels are permitted and can become quite
the spectacle. At least once a month some foreign dignitary&#39;s aide turns
up dead from a knife in the back, a poisoned drink, or a suspicious
accident.

## Palatial District Factions
The following factions may be encountered in the North Ward.

### Ducal Council
The Ducal Council advises the Duke on important matters involving the
Duchy of Valnwall and the City of Dolmvay. The council consists of the
Royal Scribe, the Wolflord, the High Watchman, the City Lawlord, the
Vaultkeeper, the Master of Guilds, the Speaker of Commons, the Lord of
Swords, and the Lord of Sails.

## Palatial District NPCs of Note
The following NPCs may be encountered in the North Ward.

### Duke Robert val Dolm
The charismatic young Duke Robert val Dolm is the current ruler of the
Duchy of Valnwall and a direct descendant of the first Willhelm val
Dolm. Duke Robert is known to be fair and just in his dealings with all
folk, regardless of their station. He works closely with the Church of
Law and Order to maintain peace and stability throughout the realm.

Despite his youth, Robert is a skilled fighter and the veteran of
several campaigns, including the famous Battle of Bracken Keep where he
led the King’s Army to victory against a large force of ruk raiders. It
is said that after the battle, the Duke left only one ruk alive to carry
word of the defeat back to its people.

The symbol of the Dolmish lords is a huge gray wolf known as the Iron
Wolf, which was also the nickname of the first Duke Willhelm val Dolm.
The royal standard is a pair of iron wolves flanking a crown above a

attractive scholar who delights in ancient history. Only the Duke and a

of High Watchman currently belongs to Stefan Morshal. Morshal is a
commoner who began his career as a City Watchman and slowly worked his
way up the ranks.

As a young Watch Captain, he gained the notice of the former Duke when
he foiled a plot by several disgraced merchant families to disrupt trade
by setting fire to the Guild Docks. Morshal despises corruption and
imposes swift punishment on Watchmen who forsake their oaths.

**High Watchman Stefan Morshal:** AL L; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 15 (chain

The City Lawlord is an emissary of the Valenon and is responsible for
advising the Duke on important matters of the faith. The current City
Lawlord is Lawlord Ethun Barrigan. Barrigan is a stout cleric with a
ruddy face and white beard. His appearance has earned him the nickname
&quot;Sainted Klaus&quot; after the popular Yuletide saint. Barrigan works closely
with the High Watchman Stefan Morshal and the two are close friends.

### Vaultkeeper
The Vaultkeeper is responsible for managing the city&#39;s treasury,
collecting taxes, financing projects, and negotiating debts with the
great moneylending guilds of Guildeland.

The current Vaultkeeper is a huge man named Georgen Hand. Vaultkeeper
Georgen moves and speaks slowly and is the butt of many jokes. In
reality, his great size and plodding demeanor conceal an extremely keen
mind. Vaultkeeper Georgen is one of the Duke&#39;s most trusted advisors.

Georgen carries the key to the Dolmvay Treasury on a chain around his
neck and would give his life to protect it. Georgen is always
accompanied by two Iron Wolves and one Lawguardian who serve as his
bodyguards.

various trade guilds. The current Master of Guilds is a fat, secretive
man named Master Jon Carswell. Carswell maintains a legion of spies who
collect blackmail information throughout the realm, making him one of
the most hated and feared men in the Duchy.

Carswell is extremely fond of fine women and wine. Many have attempted
to exploit this apparent weakness, however, Carswell seldom indulges to
excess. Master Carswell has a healthy respect for Vaultkeeper Georgen&#39;s
intellect and the two often engage in private games of strategy such as
castles and riddles.

folk of Dolmvay.

Holden who went on several adventures in her youth before opening the
Inn of the Gray Worm in Dolmvay. Marla began to dabble in politics,
gaining the respect of the common folk when she tried to promote higher
education for the poor. Marla sold the inn to a former companion named
Jak Brindle soon after she was elected as Speaker of Commons.

Marla can be naive at times and is not capable of complex intrigues.

become seduced by the lifestyle at court and is being influenced by some
of the more experienced council members and politicians (such as Lady
Lauren, below).

of Dolmvay. The current Speaker of Lords is the Lady Lauren vala
Kirkland. Lady Lauren is a beautiful and charismatic noblewoman. She is
a natural politician with a reputation for chastity and propriety.

In reality, Lady Lauren is a scheming seductress who enjoys manipulating
others. Lady Lauren routinely engages in trysts with men at court, often
ending with the untimely death of her lover. Lady Lauren holds the
interests of her family above the needs of the realm and is currently
engaged in an ongoing plan to seduce and marry Duke Robert.

of the Gulf of Valnwall and is feared by the pirates of Jameston. He is

# CITY CENTER DISTRICT
&gt; &quot;The City Center is the heart of the city. It is the only place where
&gt; those of common birth can expect the same treatment as the nobleborn.
&gt; A new age is dawning, and there are many among the old guard who
&gt; should remember that.&quot;  
&gt; —Walton don Buttersly

**Location:** Center of the North Ward along the banks of the Dolm
River.

**Neighborhoods:** Upper-class.

**Common Businesses:** Any.

**Watch Presence:** Moderate (Day); Moderate (Night)

**Things to Remember:** During the time of Xannen occupation, the City
Center District was designed to bridge the divide between noble and
commoner classes. Xannen doctrine dictates that all citizens be entitled
to the same rights, wealth, luxuries, and entertainment. Common folk
were encouraged to open businesses and occupy homes in all parts of the
North Ward, and most of them settled in the thriving City Center
District.

After imperial influence was removed from Dolmvay, many commoner
families returned to the more familiar haunts of the South Ward. The
City Center District is now home to some of the larger merchant
families, with shops that cater only to the wealthy. Think high society
establishments, master craftsmen, and noble entourages touring the
streets.

## Kingsgate
Kingsgate provides entry into the City Center District from the north.
It is the most heavily fortified gate in the city. The Kingsgarden Road
passes through Kingsgate and leads north to the royal estate of
Kingsgarden.

## City Center Docks
These docks are used by merchants, officials, and ambassadors who dwell
in and around the City Center District. The docks are named after
various animals (Crowsdock, Mulesdock, Houndsdock, etc.) and are marked
by wooden signs depicting carvings of their respective animals.

The docks lie about 10&#39; to 20&#39; below street level and are accessed by
stone staircases that hug the river walls. The docking fee is 1 sp piece
for private vessels or 5% of the cargo&#39;s value for merchant vessels. An
additional 1 sp must be paid for every week after the first. All fees
are collected by an agent of the Harbormaster and all sailors and
passengers must remain on board until the fee is paid.

## Merchant Quarter
The Merchant Quarter is home to some of the wealthiest merchant families
in Dolmvay. These merchants have strong ties to the guilds and wield
some influence in city politics. Merchant homes range in size from
multilevel apartments to manor homes, with the largest being small
walled compounds.

## Citizen&#39;s Tower
This six-story stone building is a tavern/inn frequented by famous
adventurers and wealthy employers. It consists of a common taproom on
the first floor with a stable out back and a cellar below. The second
floor contains private meeting chambers. The third and fourth floors
contain private sleeping quarters. The fifth floor consists of a single
suite that is rented only to the wealthiest and most famous adventuring
companies. The sixth floor is an open rooftop tavern with a bar and a
small stage for live entertainment. The sixth floor tavern provides a
scenic view of the North Ward.

Citizens of Dolmvay come to the Citizen&#39;s Tower to meet their favorite
adventurers and hear firsthand accounts of their latest deeds.
Adventuring companies who attract a lot of business are often given free
room and board. The Citizen&#39;s Tower serves Good to Excellent quality
meals.

## Temple Street
The Temple District once stretched for several city blocks, but now
consists of a single street known as Temple Street. A number of ancient
shrines and temples to the Gods of Amherth are located here, but only a
few of them are inhabited and maintained by priests or the scattered
faithful. The happenings on Temple Street are closely watched by agents
of the Valenon and anyone who frequents these temples comes under
scrutiny of the Church of Law and Order.

## House of Melius
The House of Melius is a high-end brothel that provides clients with a
scenic view of the Dolm River. The brothel is billed as a bathhouse and
retreat for the wealthy, and its courtesans are trained in all manner of
foreign and domestic languages and arts. The proprietor Nathen Melius is
known as an influential man, however, some say that he brokers
information gathered from tongues loosened by wine and pleasure.

## Dolmvay Coliseum
This giant stadium was built during the time of Xannen occupation and
consists of a central arena surrounded by theater-style seating. The
coliseum once featured gladiatorial combats and other savage spectacles,
but now houses plays, auctions, military drills, tourneys, mock naval
battles, and festival celebrations including the Adventurer&#39;s Challenge
during the Festival of St. Aleena, which draws adventurers from all over
the realm to compete with each other in a series of games, contests, and
challenges.

## The Siren&#39;s Call
This bathhouse is another remnant of Xannen occupation. It consists of
three large baths and a number of smaller baths and steam rooms attended
by musicians, masseuses, and caterers. The Siren&#39;s Call was once open to
the public, but is now exclusive to wealthy members.

## City Center District Factions of Note
The following factions may be encountered in the City Center District.

### Merchant Families
A number of powerful merchant families operate throughout Dolmvay. These
merchant families work in conjunction with the guilds and often have
their hands in many different enterprises, including politics. Although
the merchant families are common born, many retrace their lineage to the
time of Vay and some wield as much power as the nobility. Some merchant
families have even elevated their status by marrying their children into
struggling noble houses.

The merchant families of Dolmvay are identified by the honorific
particle &quot;don&quot; (male) or &quot;dona&quot; (female) as in Barster don Gailes or
Evelyn dona Blackmon. Male merchants are commonly referred to as Don
(i.e. Don Gailes) while female merchants are commonly referred to as
Dona (i.e. Dona Blackmon). Like the nobility, each merchant family has
its own identifying colors and symbols.

#### Blackmon Family

The Blackmon Family rose to prominence in the cloth industry and manages
several guildworks where apprentice tailors and seamstresses process,
cut, and dye common cloths such as wool and cotton. House Blackmon also
imports fine silks they claim are from the mythical Lands of the Rising
Sun. House Blackmon often hires adventurers to protect these shipments
from pirates.

#### Dandridge Family

The Dandridge Family made its fortune in jewels and antiquities.
Dandridge jewelers are expert craftsmen who specialize in custom-made
jewelry for nobles and wealthy merchants. They also pay top prices to
adventurers for antiques recovered from ancient Vay and Mor.

#### Summerland Family

The Summerland Family is known for its shipping imports, particularly
crops and livestock from the large town of Hillside Farms which lies up
the Dolm River. House Summerland often hires adventurers to protect
these shipments from thieves and hungry monsters.

### Gange Consortium

The Gange Consortium is one of the largest and most organized broklaws
in the city, with roots that stretch back to Guildeland. The Gange is
divided into rival merchant families who use wealth and power to
influence city officials, guildmasters, and even clergymen.

The most powerful Gange families are believed to be the Goldwarden
Family, the Nataglia Family, the Elderberry Family, the Farrenwald
Family, and the Radanozzo Family. These families often operate
legitimate businesses as &quot;fronts&quot; to hide their illegal activities.
Gange families demand tribute from many smaller broklaws, and employ
thugs and spellcasters to protect their operations. The High Watchman is
engaged in an ongoing campaign to disrupt Gange activities and expose
its leaders.

The Gange Consortium symbol is a raven, candle, and dagger. Each
merchant family also has its own identifying colors and symbols worked
into this design.

## City Center District NPCs of Note

not reach his eyes. Nathen owns and operates a riverfront pleasure house
named the House of Melius. Although the establishment is praised for its
discretion, Nathen himself is a dealer in information, gossip, and even
blackmail.

### Jon Black

Jon is a goodhearted street thief and magic-user who grew up on the
rough streets of the Guild District. Jon was orphaned at a young age and
lived by stealing food, coins, and whatever other valuables he could get
his hands on.

One day, he stole an intricate puzzle box from the back of a
strange-looking cart. This cart belonged to a traveling wizard named
Tristen of Tormundy. Tristen found Jon in a nearby alley just as he
solved the puzzle and opened the strange box. Tristen knew that only
someone who was exceptionally intelligent (or extremely lucky) could
have opened the box. He offered to take Jon in as his apprentice and the
boy readily accepted.

Jon excelled at his magical studies and eventually set out to adventure
on his own. He has been a member of several different adventuring
companies and is considered an asset to any party. Jon is currently a
master adventurer of the Dolmvay Adventurer&#39;s Guild and is often
consulted on matters of magic.

Despite his profession, Jon is a rogue at heart and often returns to the
taverns, brothels, and gambling dens of his youth. However, he never
takes advantage of those less fortunate than himself. When dealing with
broklaw gangs or arrogant nobles (Jon sees little difference between the
two), he often uses magic such as *charm person, clairvoyance, ESP*, and
other spells to help him fleece his opponents. Jon donates much of his
wealth to charities and other institutions that help the poor and needy.

Jon currently lives in a modest home in the City Center District. While
in the city, he prefers to avoid violence because the penalties for
using magic during the commission of a crime tend to be more severe. Jon
owns a pair of *boots of traveling and springing* which help him escape
from almost any difficult situation.

### Janni the Lucky

Janni is a jewel thief and conman with quick reflexes, good looks, and a
weakness for a pretty face. Janni was orphaned at a young age and grew
up on the rough streets of Dolmvay&#39;s District of Commons. Janni is a
pretender who wants to distance himself from his humble roots. Whenever
he has coin, he likes to associate with people of wealth in the City
Center District.

Janni is always looking for the &quot;Big Score&quot; that he believes will help
him buy his way into the upper class. His judgment is extremely bad,
however, and his risky schemes often lead to trouble with the City
Watch. Janni has recently stolen a valuable painting from the ruins of a
church building in the Valenon and is not-so-discretely looking for an
interested buyer.

**Janni the Lucky:** AL N; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 15 (leather armor + *ring of

### Sir Garon of Woodbridge

Sir Garon is a young landed knight who was born a commoner and became
squire to a knight of the noble House Brookwood. Garon was knighted
after the Battle of the Redwold when he defended his lord during a
surprise attack by knights of the rival House Delmouth. He was later
granted his own lands to the north after leading several punitive
strikes against House Delmouth.

The Duke eventually intervened in the conflict and ordered a truce
between the two noble houses. However, Sir Garon refuses to cease
hostilities against House Delmouth and often challenges its knights to
honor duels.

Sir Garon currently lives in a modest manor home in the City Center
District. His standard is a mounted knight atop an arched bridge.

**Sir Garon of Woodbridge:** AL L; Speed 30&#39; (25&#39;); AC 15 (chain mail) or

### Sergeant Sylvia Lerner

Sylvia is an intelligent Watch Sergeant who has seen the best and worst
of Dolmvay&#39;s citizens. She is currently assigned to the City Center
District, where she has effectively learned to walk the fine line
between doing her job and angering those in power.

# DISTRICT OF NOBLES
&gt; &quot;The commoners are revolting!&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Aye, I know. Just be glad they&#39;re not rebelling!&quot;  
&gt; —an old nobleman&#39;s joke

**Location:** Southernmost end of the North Ward.

**Neighborhoods:** Upper-class.

**Common Businesses:** None.

**Watch Presence:** Moderate (Day); Moderate (Night)

**Things to Remember:** This district is home to a number of noble
houses. The nobles here dwell in lavish manor homes and walled
compounds, some of which span entire city blocks. These homes tend to be
unique, eye-catching affairs, as the nobles seek ways to impress and
outdo one another.

## Noble Docks

These docks are used only by nobles. The docks are privately maintained
and named after the Noble House that owns them. The docks are identified
by the banners of their respective noble houses. The docks lie about 10&#39;
to 20&#39; below street level and are accessed by stone staircases that hug
the river walls.

## The Rainbow Halls

The centerpiece of this massive walled compound consists of a line of
seven rectangular-shaped buildings made from natural colored stone, with
each stone mirroring the color of a rainbow. The stones were imported
from all over Amherth and are rumored to produce magical effects (not
all of them benign). The Rainbow Halls are the home of House Irrlenov.

## Thirteen Spires of Lady Dalion

The Dalion manor home is marked by thirteen ornamental stone spires that
range from 20&#39; to 60&#39; tall. Banners bearing the standards of the Duchy
of Valnwall, the City of Dolmvay, and House Dalion flutter from the
three highest spires.

The spires represent the Thirteen Great Cities of ancient Amherth, but
seem to have no apparent function and exist only as a curiosity. The
Dalion gardens are filled with exotic flora and fauna, including a flock
of peacocks whose ear-splitting cries ring out throughout the day. Many
believe Lady Dalion is mad and that these shrieks are actually her own.

## Dome of val Berrien

This large domed structure and minaret tower was built by the noble lord
Korley val Berrien after his travels to the desert city of Gehedad, and
its gardens are filled with palm trees and imported statues.

Lord Korley married a desert princess named Hadiyah of the Temple Oasis
and converted to the worship of Il&#39;Re the One True God. Lord Korley
sings a haunting call to prayer every morning and evening, and the sound
has become a popular curiosity.

The Church of Law and Order refuses to recognize Lord Korley&#39;s marriage
and has ordered him to renounce Il&#39;Re or be branded a heretic.

## The Arch of Crows

This tall arch lies on the main street connecting the District of Nobles
to the City Center District. In darker times it was used to hang
political prisoners, dissidents, and impudent commoners, and draws its
name from the crows that gathered to feast on their remains. The arch is
a reminder to all that the concepts of Law and Justice are not always
the same thing.

## Halidyne Park

This grassy park is lined with stone footpaths, groves of trees, stone
fountains, and bridges crossing natural streams. It is a place where the
wealthy come to relax and socialize.

## Halstead Watchtower

The Halstead Watchtower is an outpost of the City Watch that is
responsible for patrolling the District of Nobles. It is usually
considered a favorable assignment, however, when something bad happens
in the North Ward, heads here are the first to roll. Halstead Watchmen
have a reputation for harassing commoners who are found wandering the
District of Nobles.

## District of Nobles Factions
The following factions may be encountered in the District of Nobles.

### Noble Houses
The nobles of Dolmvay are descended from the noble houses of Vay and Mor
and from the most loyal subjects of the first Duke Willhelm Dolm. The
majority of these nobles reside in opulent manor homes located in the
District of Nobles, but many also maintain large estates outside the
city walls.

The noble houses of Dolmvay are identified by the nobiliary particle
&quot;val&quot; (male) or &quot;vala&quot; (female) as in Rupert val Morgan or Lana vala
Gilmore. These nobles can trace their lineage back to the noble houses
of Vay and/or the nobles who came to Vay with the first Duke Willhelm of
Dolm.

The ancient noble houses of Mor are identified by the nobiliary particle
&quot;mor&quot; (male) or &quot;mora&quot; (female) as in Stefan mor Apperson or Evelyn mora
Wennow. These nobles traditionally tend to be less supportive of the
Duke&#39;s rule.

Nobles are referred to as Lord (male) or Lady (female). Each noble house
has its own identifying colors and symbols.

House Irrlenov, House Dalion, and House Berrien are just a few of the
noble houses found in Dolmvay.

### Order of Karth

The Order of Karth is an ancient and secretive order of wizards whose
history dates back to the Time of the Thirteen Cities. The Order was
founded in the City of Mor, but its members fled to Vay to escape the
Great City&#39;s destruction. The Church of Law and Order sought to imprison
the Order and a terrible battle was fought within the walls of Vay. The
Order was defeated and its members scattered, but they eventually
regrouped and have dedicated themselves to undermining the church and
overthrowing the Duke of Dolm.

The Order of Karth specializes in the magic of transmutation and often
utilizes shape-shifting creatures such as dopplegangers, mimics,
cloakers, and lurkers above to terrorize the citizens of Dolmvay. The
order sometimes aligns itself with treasonous nobles, Chaos priests, and
other evil beings in order to achieve its goals. They are engaged in an
ongoing shadow war with the White Wizard&#39;s Guild of Dolmvay. The Order
of Karth&#39;s standard is a stylized lightning bolt striking a great tree.
The young wizard Rethan mor Grennelon leads the Order of Karth.

## District of Nobles NPCs of Note

ancestors captured one of the &quot;wee folk&quot; of local legend and forced him
to give up his treasure.

Lord Davin has established strong ties among the elves and other faerie
folk, especially the Vanhurr elves who dwell along the borders of

to overthrow the duke and bring about the downfall of the Church of Law

### Barrugal the Infamous

One, is an evil sorcerer who has plagued the Duchy of Valnwall for many
years. Barrugal is a ruthless and vindictive murderer who has committed
all manner of atrocities in his quest for knowledge and power. His very
name is a curse that is seldom spoken for fear of drawing his attention.

Barrugal believes that the blood sacrifice of innocents strengthens his
magic. His minions and spies are everywhere and he often uses others to
do his bidding. Barrugal figures into numerous dark myths and legends
and is believed to be far older than he appears—many suggest that he is
not entirely human.

Barrugal has only recently come to Dolmvay after a stint in the court of
the Duke&#39;s estranged uncle, the Earl Uther mor Calwell. Barrugal
currently resides as a guest in the manor home of House Grennelon.

### Gweneth, Daughter of Sar

Gweneth is a halfruk female who appears as an ugly human, with
pronounced canines, a square jaw, and a bluish tinge to her skin.
Despite her brutish appearance, she is surprisingly well spoken and is a
student of myth and lore.

Gweneth was born in the wildlands north of the ruins of Mor and spent
some time adventuring with her sisters Constance and Frigga in an
adventuring company known as &quot;The Furies&quot;. Some of her most notable
exploits include expeditions to the Barrow Tombs of the Eastern Plains,
the defeat of an ogre clan led by the notorious Sawney Bean, and a
running battle against the Red Moon Ruks which came to be known as the
Battle of Glass Mountain.

A year ago, Gweneth was traveling to Dolmvay when she came upon a mother
and two children who had been kidnapped by brigands. Gweneth rescued the
children, but their mother was gravely injured. On her deathbed, she
begged Gweneth to protect the children, a six-year-old boy named Adom
and a three-year-old girl named Alise, both heirs to the noble House
Penrose.

The father of the children, Lord Tranton val Penrose, has allowed
Gweneth to stay on as nursemaid and bodyguard. Although he does not
entirely trust Gweneth, the uniqueness of her bestial nature has
elevated his status amongst his peers. For her part, Gweneth has come to
love the children as if they were her own.

# PALATIAL DISTRICT
The Palatial District is home to the Duke and
his family as well as the wealthiest nobles and royal ambassadors from
other realms. It is the most heavily guarded area of the city. Think
military patrols, foreign retinues, and royal entourages.  

Continues at [[Palatial District]].

# CITY CENTER DISTRICT
During the time of Xannen occupation, the City
Center District was designed to bridge the divide between noble and
commoner classes. Xannen doctrine dictates that all citizens be entitled
to the same rights, wealth, luxuries, and entertainment. Common folk
were encouraged to open businesses and occupy homes in all parts of the
North Ward, and most of them settled in the thriving City Center
District.

After imperial influence was removed from Dolmvay, many commoner
families returned to the more familiar haunts of the South Ward. The
City Center District is now home to some of the larger merchant
families, with shops that cater only to the wealthy. Think high society
establishments, master craftsmen, and noble entourages touring the
streets.  

Continues at [[City Center District]].

# DISTRICT OF NOBLES
This district is home to a number of noble
houses. The nobles here dwell in lavish manor homes and walled
compounds, some of which span entire city blocks. These homes tend to be
unique, eye-catching affairs, as the nobles seek ways to impress and
outdo one another.

The District of Scholars is one of the newer
city districts. It is funded by the wealthy, and most of its buildings
are made of stone and decorated with murals and bas-relief carvings.

The district is home to a number of private libraries, theaters, art
galleries, and houses of academia, that attract all manner of sages,
scholars, artists, poets, and other men of higher learning. A number of
small parks and gardens are also scattered throughout.

Think philosophers holding class in public squares, men and women
hurrying back and forth with bundles of scrolls, and street side poets
stopping to transcribe an inspired verse.

river market, and a few wealthy families who either refuse or are unable
to relocate.  

Continues at [[River District]].



# THE VALENON

### Neighborhoods
Middle-class.

### Common Businesses
Any (mainly churches and scholars).

### Watch Presence
High (Day); Moderate (Night). The Valenon maintains
its own armed patrols known as Hiltamen that are not part

and Order. It is the center of religious power in Dolmvay as well as the
Duchy of Valnwall. The church considers itself the voice of the common
people and as such it is fittingly located in the South Ward. Think
robed monks, religious bells, and pilgrimages from all over the duchy.  

Continues at [[The Valenon]].


# GUILD DISTRICT

### Neighborhoods
Lower-class with some middle-class

### Common Businesses
Armorers, blacksmiths, breweries, cobblers,
churches, guildworks, leatherworkers, mills, stockyards, taverns,
warehouses.

### Watch Presence
Low (Day); Moderate (Night).

### Things to Remember
The guild district is home to a number of
warehouses, stockyards, granaries, mills, and guildworks, as well as
living quarters for the laborers and craftsmen who work in them. The
Guild District extends both above and below street level (known as the
Underguild), with almost as many streets, shops, homes, and guildworks
found underground as there are above.

Think rough workers, the sounds of chipping at stone and hammer on
anvil, dank staircases leading to underground tunnels, and the smell of
fresh blood, offal, and rotting carcasses.  

Continues at [[Guild District]].





# DISTRICT OF COMMONS

### Neighborhoods
Middle-class with some lower-class.

### Common Businesses
Armorers, bakers, blacksmiths, butchers,

middle-class residential and shop district inhabited by craftsmen,
merchants, soldiers, and retired adventurers.

district established in Dolmvay and its buildings are made almost
entirely of stone. Think City Watchmen entering and leaving the
barracks, citizens of Dolmvay bringing grievances before the courts, and
public executions and other punishments.  

Continues at [[Oldcastle District]].



# BAYTOWN

### Neighborhoods
Slums.

### Common Businesses
Boat builders, brothels, butchers, churches,
fishmongers, inns, ropemaker/netmakers, taverns, warehouses.

### Watch Presence
Low (Day); None (Night)

### Things to Remember
This wretched slum neighborhood lies just
outside the city walls. It is a place of sin and vice that is shunned by
law-abiding folk. The taverns, inns, and brothels of Baytown are among
the worst dives in all of Dolmvay. Think poverty, unwashed sailors,
barroom brawls, clandestine meetings, and back alley murders.  

Continues at [[Baytown]].



# WHARF DISTRICT

Lower-class and slums.

### Common Businesses
Boat builders, brothels, butchers, churches,
fishmongers, inns, ropemaker/netmakers, taverns, warehouses.

districts in Dolmvay. Think the smell of the open sea, fishermen
haggling over the day&#39;s catch, ships sailing in and out of King&#39;s Bay,
teamsters loading and unloading cargo, raucous taverns and brothels, and
foreign sailors from all over Amherth.  

Continues at [[Wharf District]].




# MARKET DISTRICT

### Neighborhoods
Middle-class and lower-class.

### Common Businesses
Any.

foreign merchants from all over Amherth.

# PLAGUE TOWN
This small collection of shacks and hillside caves began as a leper
colony, but has expanded to include all those suffering from terminal
diseases. The colony is centered around the Church of St. Callor whose
priests attempt to ease the suffering of the sick and dying.

According to church history, St. Callor was a holy man who died from a
strange fever and then rose from the dead to spread the glory of Law and
Order in the lands far to the north. Although the lepers are
considered active members of the church, it is felt they can contribute
nothing significant to the good of the church and are therefore not
entitled to church healing magic.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="48" name="NPCS" tags="index @main-npcs" position="1482,875" size="100,100">

# Ducal Docks
These heavily guarded docks double as a royal shipyard and are used only
for official ducal business. The docks are named after various royal
titles (Earlsdock, Dukesdock, Kingsdock, etc.) and each dock bears royal
heraldry. The docks lie about 10&#39; to 20&#39; below street level and are
accessed by stone staircases that hug the river walls. The Duke&#39;s
personal ship, the *Star of Dolm*, is moored here along with a number of
other royal and military vessels.

# Ducal Palace
The Ducal Palace lies at the center of a sprawling walled compound known
as the Palatial District. The palace is an impressive structure marked
by tall spires, fluttering banners, crenellated battlements, and open
courtyards. The throne room and lower levels of the palace are open to
the public throughout the day. The Duke and his family dwell in private
chambers located in the upper levels.

# Royal Dungeons
The Royal Dungeons lie deep beneath the Ducal Palace. They are a dismal
place that consist of many cells, holding areas, and torture chambers,
with the most vile criminals being housed in the lowermost levels. In
times past, the dungeon guards were recruited from the cruelest and most
sadistic jailers in the land, and the few prisoners lucky enough to be
released seldom left with their minds and/or bodies intact. A secret
passage connecting the dungeons to the sewers is rumored to exist.

# Ducal Square
The Ducal Square is an open courtyard inside the palace compound where
the Duke can address his loyal subjects. During festival times, citizens
fill the square, entertainers (bards, jugglers, puppeteers, etc.) vie
for attention, and vendors hawk their wares from the surrounding
arcades. The square has been the site of several high-profile public
executions over the years.

# Chapel of St. Valen
The Chapel of St. Valen is located adjacent to the Ducal Palace. It is
the second largest church in the city (see the Cathedral of St. Poul,
pg. 48) and its lower levels are said to connect to the ancient warrens
beneath the Son of Sons monument. The chapel is famous for
its stained glass windows which depict the heroic Valen of Vay and his
victories over the war machines of Aal to the west and the undead
kingdom of Makaar Mor to the north.

# Ambassador Quarter 
This quarter is home to foreign human ambassadors and their retinues as
well as contingents of elves and dwarves from the nearby kingdoms of
Vanhurr and Gundamark. The shops and taverns here are high-end
establishments with strict standards for etiquette and dress.

The Ambassador Quarter is thick with spying and intrigue. Although open
conflict is forbidden, honor duels are permitted and can become quite
the spectacle. At least once a month some foreign dignitary&#39;s aide turns

# Cave of the Sea God
This sea cave complex located on the northernmost shores of Baytown is
actually a shrine to an ancient reptilian sea god named Gurosulla. The
worship of Gurosulla began far across the sea in the mythical Lands of
the Rising Sun, where it is said that the gargantuan lizard was born of
a union between titan and sea dragon.

According to legend, Gurosulla chooses to dwell in the deepest parts of
the ocean, but occasionally surfaces to vent his wrath in the form of
hurricanes, whirlpools, volcanic eruptions, and tidal waves.

The Cave of the Sea God floods with the rising tide, drowning any who
are caught within. A crude stone altar bearing a statue of the bipedal
Gurosulla is located in the rearmost cave, and the cave floor is
littered with coins, trinkets, and the bones of drowned animals (and
some humans) that were left as sacrifices by local fishermen and
sailors. Anyone who takes one of these items suffers the Wrath of the
Sea God—any time the character enters water that is over his head, he
sinks to the bottom as if he weighed 1,000 pounds (see the *Labyrinth
Lord™* core rulebook for rules on drowning).

Certain spells cast on the character (such as *fly, levitate*, etc.)
allow the character to escape the water. Otherwise, the DM
must decide whether or not the character&#39;s companions have the strength
to rescue him. A *remove curse* spell cast by a cleric of at least 12th
level is needed to break the curse.

# Menagerie of the Fantastic and Bizarre
This walled compound lies close to the District of Scholars. The
menagerie is a collection of stuffed display scenes, live animal
exhibits, and trained animal shows. The Menagerie caters mostly to a
wealthy clientele. The cost to enter is 5 gp per person. A guided tour
is 10 gp per person.

The Menagerie is owned and operated by a former adventuring fighter
named Jarlos the Brash. Jarlos hires adventurers to capture specific
exotic and magical creatures for his displays, sometimes paying double
what the Adventurer&#39;s Guild normally pays for such animals.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="59" name="Pasaje sin título" tags="lugares @district-of-scholars-map" position="920,1326" size="100,100">
# Gosling Theater
This three-story theater is famous for its social, political, and even
religious satires. These performances have come under fire in the past
from angry nobles and religious officials, but the theater has the full
support of the public and has been able to weather all controversies.
The theater&#39;s mascot, known as &quot;Gozzy the Goose&quot;, is a brash performer
named Devan Bradberry who dresses as a goose and gets into mischief in
different parts of the city.

# House of Albritton
This well-kept tavern/inn is frequented by a younger crowd of scholars,
minstrels, and students. The first floor contains an open taproom,
kitchens, and several small private meeting chambers. The second floor
contains private sleeping chambers. The House of Albritton serves Good
quality meals. The tavern hosts open stage nights where aspiring
minstrels and poets can recite their works and be judged by their peers.

# Tower of Winds
This innocuous-looking four-story building belongs to a group of
scholars known as the Society of Winds whose stated mission is to
measure the strength of air circulation in various parts of the city
during different times of the day, month, and year.

The first floor contains private sitting rooms, a dining room, kitchens,
and a display room containing fans, pinwheels, flags, and sails from all
over Amherth. The second and third floors contain private members&#39;
chambers. The fourth floor houses the society&#39;s elderly headmaster,
Bryan Sturlaker.

The Society of Winds is actually a front for the White Wizard&#39;s Guild of
Dolmvay (see below) with hidden laboratories and secret libraries
located in an extensive complex beneath the tower.

# Dyson&#39;s Delve
This cramped basement shop is packed with book-lined shelves, stacks of
old scrolls, map collections, regional atlases, adventure logs, and
random scribblings. A secret entrance to Dolmvay&#39;s sewers is believed to
be hidden behind the clutter. Various maps can be purchased from Dyson
the Cartographer who sleeps on a pallet in a dark corner of the room and
almost never leaves the shop.

# Cathedral of St. Mincival the Grand
St. Mincival was a charming performer who was known for his skill with a
lute, his bravery, and his ability to see the kindness and beauty in all
men. The Cathedral of St. Mincival is a converted temple of the Love
Goddess Jesil that was built on the site long ago. It consists of a
rectangular stone hall whose roof is supported by stone columns. Various
entertainers perform in front of the church and in the park across the
street in the hopes of receiving donations or patronage.

# Theater of Bertollo
The Theater of Bertollo is an open amphitheater built upon a grassy
hill. The theater hosts several festivals throughout the year as well as
biweekly plays, acrobat shows, and other performances. The Theater of
Bertollo was the site of a gruesome massacre when a rogue adventuring
company named the Talons Three beheaded and staked the members of a
popular acting troupe called the Night Wives during one of their more
risque performances. The Talons Three then fled the city and have not
been seen since.

# Library of Torbett
Master Torus Torbett was an eccentric historian who spent much of his
life acquiring books, copying scrolls, and recording ancient legends
down on paper. After his death, he left instructions that his collection
be open to the public and that it remain in a disorganized state.

The library is a cramped collection of shelves, tables, and private
rooms spread throughout two floors above ground, with an extensive
cellar below that is rumored to contain secret hidden chambers. It is
frequented mainly by scholars, curious adventurers, and agents of the
church who occasionally comb through the haphazard mass of written works
in search of heretical documents.

# Halls of Learning
The Halls of Learning are a private collection of named buildings where
various subjects and fields of study are taught and discussed. The halls
are located close to the Library of Torbett in what many consider to be
the Academic Quarter.

A recent petition started by several prominent scholars is asking for
the city treasury to back funding for a consolidated university centered
around the Halls of Learning, but the proposal has yet to be brought
before the Duke.

# Tenkar&#39;s Tavern
Tenkar&#39;s Tavern is a well-kept tavern that is frequented mainly by
scholars, adventurers, and reputable demihumans. The Tavern has become a
haven for amateur creative types, with nightly songs, stories, games,
giveaways, and poetry readings being common forms of live entertainment.

The first floor contains an open taproom, kitchens, and several private
meeting rooms, with a stable out back and a cellar below. Tenkar&#39;s
Tavern serves Good quality meals. It is owned and operated by a
red-bearded dwarf named Tenkar the Barkeep who resides in an apartment
above the tavern.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="60" name="The Valenon Map" tags="lugares @the-valenon-map" position="1415,280" size="100,100">
# Valenon Docks
These private docks are used only for church business. The docks are
named after various saints (St. Lucilla&#39;s Dock, St. Brandon&#39;s Dock, St.
Kristoff&#39;s Dock, etc.) and bear a statue of their respective saints. The
docks lie about 10&#39; to 20&#39; below street level and are accessed by stone
staircases that hug the river walls.

# Gates of St. Poul
These gates provide access to the Valenon Docks. Only vessels on
official church business are allowed to pass through this gate.

# Eastgate and Westgate
These manned gates provide access to and from the Valenon. The gates are
closed at night.

# Cathedral of St. Poul of the Shield
This enormous cathedral is dedicated to St. Poul of the Shield, who
served with honor as Valen&#39;s right-hand man during the legendary War of
Light and the Ghoul Wars. It is the most prominent building in the
Valenon and considered one of the three holiest sites of the Church of
Law and Order.

The cathedral consists of a main chapel with numerous halls, chambers,
and smaller chapels located throughout. The interior is lavishly
decorated with stained glass windows, marble floors, bas-relief
carvings, elaborate sculptures, and gilded portals.

A famous mural known as the Victorious Son adorns the ceiling of the
main chapel. Painted by the renowned artist Stevan val Aerdon, this
mural depicts St. Valen leading his host to victory over the forces of
Chaos. The head of the church, known as the High Lawlord, dwells in the
upper levels of the cathedral, and his audience chamber balcony
overlooks St. Poul&#39;s Square.

# St. Poul&#39;s Square
This wide open square courtyard consists of a large fountain surrounded
by massive colonnades. A 10&#39; tall statue atop the fountain depicts St.
Poul holding his namesake shield. Thousands of dovecrows grace the
square. Perches on seven of the colonnades are reserved for the Holy
Serphala (see [[The Valenon]]) to sit and sing during certain services. St.  

Poul&#39;s Square is where the High Lawlord addresses the faithful on the
holiest days and festivals.

# Tomb of St. Poul
This sacred underground tomb is located directly beneath the cathedral&#39;s
main chapel and houses the remains of St. Poul of the Shield. The tomb
consists of a stone sarcophagus inside a vaulted chamber whose walls are
lined with statues, columns, and religious inscriptions. The
claw-scarred Shield of St. Poul hangs from two golden
chains affixed to the ceiling above the sarcophagus. Visitors are
permitted access to the tomb only on the holiest of days.

# Holy Aerie
This tall domed structure made of stone and glass houses the church&#39;s
flock of Holy Serphala. The serphala dwell in an open garden that takes
up most of the interior. Arched windows spaced evenly around the dome
may be opened to allow the serphala to fly in and out. The aerie is
tended by the clergy and is not open to the public.

# Catacombs of the Dead
The ancient tunnels beneath the Valenon are filled with secret
libraries, hidden vaults, and private tombs and burial chambers.

One of the most famous mass burial chamber is known as the Catacombs of
the Dead. Here, the remains of the faithful who choose to be interred by
the church are prepared and their bones mounted in the tunnel walls. In
this way, the deceased becomes a part of the church and loved ones
believe that prayers made at any shrine puts them in touch with
relatives who have passed.

A number of rumors suggest the catacombs occasionally succumb to undead
outbreaks, but this talk is fiercely denied by the church.

# Hall of Order and the Gardens of Law
The Hall of Order is an enormous library and museum filled with
religious statues, texts, and libraries. The hall is an historian&#39;s
paradise that shows a glimpse into Amalor&#39;s tumultuous past, although
some have criticized that these accounts were written from an entirely
religious perspective. The Hall of Order is extremely well organized and
is open and free to the public.

The Gardens of Law surround the Hall of Order. These gardens are a
collection of well-manicured gardens containing shrines to various
saints. Stone fences and tall hedgerows separate these gardens into
smaller courtyards that are designed to promote privacy and reflection.
These courtyards are filled with fountains, ponds, and religious
statues.

# Hall of Holy Studies
The Hall of Holy Studies is a serene dormitory, meeting hall, and
garden.

Twice per year, a select group of worshipers come here to pray, discuss
church doctrine, and learn the history of the church. This period of
study lasts for one month, during which time the church pays all of the
person&#39;s normal expenses (and that of his or her family&#39;s). The
curriculum is specially designed to determine whether or not any of
these handpicked worshipers have the potential to become one of the
Blessed.

At the end of the course, a special Son&#39;s Day ceremony is held and the
priests cast a *detect holy* spell on all worshipers in attendance.
Those found worthy are inducted into the clergy and trained to be a
spellcasting cleric.

# Valenon Vault
This secret underground vault lies beneath the Valenon and is guarded by
a faction of religious fanatics known as the White Crossguard. The
Valenon Vault supposedly holds the wealth of the Church of Law and
Order. Legends say that the vault also holds some of the church&#39;s
holiest relics, tomes, and darkest secrets, as well as evil magical
artifacts that were too powerful to destroy. Some say the vault is a
single fortified chamber, some say it consists of several chambers
hidden beneath the Valenon, while others say the vault is a fantasy that
does not even exist.
