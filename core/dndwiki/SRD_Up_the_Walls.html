<p>You can run on walls for brief distances.

<p>While you are psionically focused, you can take part of one of your <a href="SRD_Move_Actions.html" title="SRD:Move Actions">move actions</a> to traverse a wall or other relatively smooth vertical surface if you begin and end your move on a horizontal surface. The height you can achieve on the wall is limited only by this movement restriction. If you do not end your move on a horizontal surface, you fall <a href="SRD_Prone.html" title="SRD:Prone">prone</a>, taking falling damage as appropriate for your distance above the ground. Treat the wall as a normal floor for the purpose of measuring your movement. Passing from floor to wall or wall to floor costs no movement; you can change surfaces freely. Opponents on the ground can make <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a> as you move up the wall.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Special">Special</span></h5>
<p>You can take other <a href="SRD_Move_Actions.html" title="SRD:Move Actions">move actions</a> in conjunction with moving along a wall. For instance, the Spring Attack <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> allows you to make an attack from the wall against a foe standing on the ground who is within the area you threaten; however, if you are somehow prevented from completing your move, you fall. Likewise, you could tumble along the wall to avoid <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a>.
