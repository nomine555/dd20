<p><b>Helm of Brilliance: </b>This normal-looking helm takes its true form and manifests its <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> when the user dons it and speaks the command word. Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set with large magic gems: ten diamonds, twenty rubies, thirty fire opals, and forty opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crownlike, gem-tipped spikes. The jewelsâ€™ functions are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Diamond: <i><a href="SRD_Prismatic_Spray.html" title="SRD:Prismatic Spray">Prismatic spray</a> </i>(save <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 20)
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Ruby: <i><a href="SRD_Wall_of_Fire.html" title="SRD:Wall of Fire">Wall of fire</a></i>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Fire opal: <i><a href="SRD_Fireball.html" title="SRD:Fireball">Fireball</a> </i>(10d6, <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 20 half )
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Opal: <i><a href="SRD_Daylight.html" title="SRD:Daylight">Daylight</a></i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The helm may be used once per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a <i>helm of brilliance </i>also has the following magical properties when activated.
</p>
<ul>
<li> It emanates a bluish light when <a href="SRD_Undead_Type.html" title="SRD:Undead Type">undead</a> are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> to all such creatures within that range.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a <a href="SRD_Flaming.html" title="SRD:Flaming">flaming weapon</a>. This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> to take effect.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> The helm provides resistance to fire 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it.
</p><p>If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Will</a> save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become <i>prismatic sprays </i>that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line <i>walls of fire </i>extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become <i>fireballs </i>centered on the helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed.
