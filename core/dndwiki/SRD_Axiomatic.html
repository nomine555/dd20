<p><b>Axiomatic:</b> An axiomatic weapon is lawfully aligned and infused with the power of law. It makes the weapon law-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of <a href="SRD_Creatures.html#Creatures_by_Alignment" title="SRD:Creatures">chaotic alignment</a>. It bestows one <a href="SRD_Energy_Drain%2c_Negative_Levels%2c_and_Level_Loss.html#Negative_Levels" title="SRD:Energy Drain, Negative Levels, and Level Loss">negative level</a> on any chaotic creature attempting to wield it. The <a href="SRD_Energy_Drain%2c_Negative_Levels%2c_and_Level_Loss.html#Negative_Levels" title="SRD:Energy Drain, Negative Levels, and Level Loss">negative level</a> remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This <a href="SRD_Energy_Drain%2c_Negative_Levels%2c_and_Level_Loss.html#Negative_Levels" title="SRD:Energy Drain, Negative Levels, and Level Loss">negative level</a> never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including <i><a href="SRD_Restoration.html" title="SRD:Restoration">restoration</a></i> spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the lawful power upon their ammunition.
