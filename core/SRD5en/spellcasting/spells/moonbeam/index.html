<p><em>2nd-level evocation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute </p>
<p>A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot- radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.  <br/>
When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  <br/>
A shapechanger makes its saving throw with <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a>. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.  <br/>
On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction. </p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd. </p></div>
