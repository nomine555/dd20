<p>You impress the totality of your psyche into a subject’s subconscious. If successfully implanted, the seed of your mind “germinates” over the period of one week. During this time, the subject begins to unconsciously take on your mannerisms. 
</p><p>When integration is complete (after one week), the subject becomes you in mind as you were when you manifested the power, but the subject’s level is eight lower than your own. (In effect, the subject has received eight <a href="SRD_Energy_Drain%2c_Negative_Levels%2c_and_Level_Loss.html#Negative_Levels" title="SRD:Energy Drain, Negative Levels, and Level Loss">negative levels</a>—but these are negative levels that can’t be removed.) The subject does not have any of your physical ability scores or equipment, but does have the <a href="SRD_Intelligence.html" title="SRD:Intelligence">Intelligence</a>, <a href="SRD_Wisdom.html" title="SRD:Wisdom">Wisdom</a>, and <a href="SRD_Charisma.html" title="SRD:Charisma">Charisma</a> scores you had when you were eight levels lower. The subject also knows the <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> you knew when you were eight levels lower.
</p><p>While the subject is initially your mental duplicate, the two personalities diverge over time. Although the subject starts off with memories of your experiences, it possesses its original “soul” and physical body and is free to develop its own personality based on its own new experiences. Thus, the subject is not your slave or servant, but instead a nonplayer character in its own right that shares your earlier memories.
</p><p><i><a href="SRD_Protection_from_Evil.html" title="SRD:Protection from Evil">Protection from evil</a> </i>or a similar spell or power can prevent you from implanting <i>mind seed, </i>or prevent a seed from germinating while the protective power lasts. Otherwise, a germinating seed can be removed (prior to germination) only by <i><a href="SRD_Psychic_Chirurgery.html" title="SRD:Psychic Chirurgery">psychic chirurgery</a>, <a href="SRD_Reality_Revision.html" title="SRD:Reality Revision">reality revision</a></i>, or similarly high-level effects. Manifesting <i>mind seed </i>again during the germination period also cleanses the subject’s mind.
</p><p><i>XP Cost: </i>3,000 XP.
