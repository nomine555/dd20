<p><em>5th-level transmutation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 8 hours <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes) <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p>
<p>After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/intelligence/index.html">Intelligence</a> score or an <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/intelligence/index.html">Intelligence</a> of 3 or less. The target gains an <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/intelligence/index.html">Intelligence</a> of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. Your GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/awakened_shrub/index.html">Awakened Shrub</a> or the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/awakened_tree/index.html">Awakened Tree</a>. <br/>
The awakened beast or plant is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a> by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a> condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a>.</p></div>
