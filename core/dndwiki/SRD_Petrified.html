<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Petrified">Petrified</span></h3>
<p>A petrified character has been <a href="SRD_Turned.html" title="SRD:Turned">turned</a> to stone and is considered <a href="SRD_Unconscious.html" title="SRD:Unconscious">unconscious</a>. If a petrified character cracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined with the body as he returns to flesh, he is unharmed. If the characterâ€™s petrified body is incomplete when it returns to flesh, the body is likewise incomplete and there is some amount of permanent hit point loss and/or debilitation.
