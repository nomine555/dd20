<p>A creature with this special quality has the ability to assume the appearance of a specific creature or type of creature (usually a <a href="SRD_Humanoid_Type.html" title="SRD:Humanoid Type">humanoid</a>), but retains most of its own physical qualities. <span class="errata">A <a href="SRD_True_Seeing.html" title="SRD:True Seeing"><i>true seeing</i></a> spell or ability reveals the creature’s natural form. A creature using change shape reverts to its natural form when killed, but separated body parts retain their shape. A creature cannot use change shape to take the form of a creature with a template.</span> <s>A creature cannot change shape to a form more than one <a href="SRD_Size_Category.html" title="SRD:Size Category" class="mw-redirect">size category</a> smaller or larger than its original form.</s> Changing shape results in the following changes to the creature:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The creature retains the type and subtype of its original form. It gains the size of its new form.
</li>
<li> <span class="errata">The creature loses the <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Natural_Weapon" title="SRD:Natural Weapon" class="mw-redirect">natural weapons</a> and movement modes of its original form, as well as any extraordinary special attacks of its original form not derived from <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">class levels</a> (such as the <a href="SRD_Barbarian.html" title="SRD:Barbarian">barbarian</a>’s rage <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> feature).</span> <s>The creature loses the <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Natural_Weapon" title="SRD:Natural Weapon" class="mw-redirect">natural weapons</a>, movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its original form.</s>
</li>
<li> The creature gains the <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Natural_Weapon" title="SRD:Natural Weapon" class="mw-redirect">natural weapons</a>, movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its new form.
</li>
<li> The creature retains all other special attacks and qualities of its original form, except for breath weapons and gaze attacks.
</li>
<li> The creature retains the ability scores of its original form.
</li>
<li> <span class="errata">Except as described elsewhere, the creature retains all other game statistics of its original form, including (but not necessarily limited to) <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">HD</a>, <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>, skill ranks, <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feats</a>, <a href="SRD_Base_Attack_Bonus.html" title="SRD:Base Attack Bonus" class="mw-redirect">base attack bonus</a>, and base save bonuses.</span> <s>The creature retains its <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> and saves.</s>
</li>
<li> The creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its original form, although it must be able to speak intelligibly to cast spells with verbal components and it must have humanlike hands to cast spells with somatic components.
</li>
<li> The creature is effectively camouflaged as a creature of its new form, and gains a +10 bonus on <a href="SRD_Disguise_Skill.html" title="SRD:Disguise Skill">Disguise</a> checks if it uses this ability to create a disguise.
</li>
<li> <span class="errata">Any gear worn or carried by the creature that can’t be worn or carried in its new form instead falls to the ground in its space. If the creature changes size, any gear it wears or carries that can be worn or carried in its new form changes size to match the new size. (Nonhumanoid-shaped creatures can’t wear armor designed for <a href="SRD_Humanoid_Type.html" title="SRD:Humanoid Type">humanoid</a>-shaped creatures, and viceversa.) Gear returns to normal size if dropped.</span>
