The intended victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be good, and if he is not exceptionally pure in thought and deed the evil character gains a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 19 <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> to leap away from the crack. Obviously, the target must be standing on solid ground for this item to function.
