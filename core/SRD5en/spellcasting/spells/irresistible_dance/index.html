<p><em>6th-level enchantment</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action  <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet  <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V  <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute </p>
<p>Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that can't be <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a> are immune to this spell.  <br/>
A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a> on <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a> on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the spell ends.</p></div>
