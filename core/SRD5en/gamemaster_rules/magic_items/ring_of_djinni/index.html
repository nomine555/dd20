<p><em>Ring, legendary (requires attunement)</em> </p>
<p>While wearing this ring, you can speak its command word as an action to summon a particular <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/djinni/index.html">Djinni</a> from the Elemental Plane of Air. The <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/djinni/index.html">Djinni</a> appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its home plane.  <br/>
While summoned, the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/djinni/index.html">Djinni</a> is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fail to command it, the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/djinni/index.html">Djinni</a> defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.  <br/>
After the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/djinni/index.html">Djinni</a> departs, it can't be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/djinni/index.html">Djinni</a> dies. </p></div>
