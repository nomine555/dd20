<p><strong>Aberrant Ground.</strong> The ground in a 10-foot radius around the mouther is doughlike <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/combat/movement_and_position/index.html#difficult-terrain">Difficult Terrain</a>. Each creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 10 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.  <br/>
<strong>Gibbering.</strong> The mouther babbles incoherently while it can see any creature and isn't <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Incapacitated</a>. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the mouther and can hear the gibbering must succeed on a DC 10 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> saving throw. On a failure, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can't make such an attack. </p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> The gibbering mouther makes one bite attack and, if it can, uses its Blinding Spittle.  <br/>
<strong>Bite.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 17 (5d6) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 10 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> saving throw or be knocked <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Prone</a>. If the target is killed by this damage, it is absorbed into the mouther.  <br/>
<strong>Blinding Spittle (Recharge 5–6).</strong> The mouther spits a chemical glob at a point it can see within 15 feet of it. The glob explodes in a blinding flash of light on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of the flash must succeed on a DC 13 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw or be <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Blinded</a> until the end of the mouther's next turn.</p></div>
