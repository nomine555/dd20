<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spells">Spells</span></h3>
<p>Sometimes a creature can cast arcane or divine spells just as a member of a spellcasting <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> can (and can activate magic items accordingly). Such creatures are subject to the same spellcasting rules that characters are, except as follows. 
</p><p>A spellcasting creature that lacks hands or arms can provide any somatic component a spell might require by moving its body. Such a creature also does need material components for its spells. The creature can cast the spell by either touching the required component (but not if the component is in another creatureâ€™s possession) or having the required component on its person. Sometimes spellcasting creatures utilize the Eschew Materials <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> to avoid fussing with noncostly components.
</p><p>A spellcasting creature is not actually a member of a <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> unless its entry says so, and it does not gain any <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> abilities. A creature with access to <a href="SRD_Cleric.html" title="SRD:Cleric">cleric</a> spells must prepare them in the normal manner and receives domain spells if noted, but it does not receive domain granted <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> unless it has at least one level in the <a href="SRD_Cleric.html" title="SRD:Cleric">cleric</a> <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a>.

<p>Creatures with psionic <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> are similar to creatures with racial spellcasting ability. They have the ability to manifest <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> just as a member of a psionic <a href="SRD_Classes.html" title="SRD:Classes">character class</a> can (and can activate psionic items accordingly).
</p><p>Creatures with the ability to use <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> are subject to the same rules for manifesting <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> that characters are, but they are not actually members of a <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> and do not gain any <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> abilities unless otherwise specified.
</p><p>Creatures with psionic <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> generally emulate the manifesting ability of a particular psionic <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a>. When such a creature takes levels in that same <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a>, it can stack its innate psionic <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> and its <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> power progression together. 
</p><p>Creatures with psionic <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> that take levels in a <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> other than the one they emulate combine their two <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power point</a> reserves into a single reserve, but they manifest <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> from each psionic <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> separately.
