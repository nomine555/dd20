<p><b>Candle of Invocation: </b>Each of these special tapers is dedicated to one of the nine alignments. Simply burning the candle generates a favorable aura for the individual so doing if the candle’s alignment matches that of the character. Characters of the same alignment as the burning candle add a +2 morale bonus on <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack rolls</a>, <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throws</a>, and <a href="SRD_Skill_Check.html" title="SRD:Skill Check" class="mw-redirect">skill checks</a> while within 30 feet of the flame.
</p><p>A <a href="SRD_Cleric.html" title="SRD:Cleric">cleric</a> whose alignment matches the candle’s operates as if two levels higher for purposes of determining spells per day if he burns the candle during or just prior to his spell preparation time. He can even cast spells normally unavailable to him, as if he were of that higher level, but only so long as the candle continues to burn. Except in special cases (see below), a candle burns for 4 hours.
</p><p>In addition, burning a candle also allows the owner to cast a <i><a href="SRD_Gate.html" title="SRD:Gate">gate</a> </i>spell, the respondent being of the same alignment as the candle, but the taper is immediately consumed in the process. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like. Doing this doesn’t interfere with its magical properties.
