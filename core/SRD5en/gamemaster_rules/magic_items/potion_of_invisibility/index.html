<p><em>Potion, very rare</em> </p>
<p>This potion's container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Invisible</a> for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Invisible</a> with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell. </p></div>
