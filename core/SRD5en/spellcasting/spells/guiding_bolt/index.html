<p>A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a>, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then. </p>
