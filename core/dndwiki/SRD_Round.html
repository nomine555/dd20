<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="How_Combat_Works">How Combat Works</span></h3>
<p>Combat is cyclical; everybody acts in turn in a regular cycle of rounds. Combat follows this sequence:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Each combatant starts out <a href="SRD_Flat-Footed.html" title="SRD:Flat-Footed">flat-footed</a>. Once a combatant acts, he or she is no longer <a href="SRD_Flat-Footed.html" title="SRD:Flat-Footed">flat-footed</a>.
</li>
<li>Determine which characters are aware of their opponents at the start of the battle. If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a <a href="SRD_Initiative.html#Surprise" title="SRD:Initiative">surprise round</a> happens before regular rounds of combat begin. The combatants who are aware of the opponents can act in the surprise <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, so they roll for <a href="SRD_Initiative.html" title="SRD:Initiative">initiative</a>. In initiative order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of their opponents each take one action (either a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> or a <a href="SRD_Move_Actions.html" title="SRD:Move Actions">move action</a>) during the surprise <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. Combatants who were unaware do not get to act in the surprise <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. If no one or everyone starts the battle aware, there is no surprise <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>.
</li>
<li>Combatants who have not yet rolled initiative do so. All combatants are now ready to begin their first regular <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> of combat.
</li>
<li>Combatants act in initiative order (highest to lowest).
</li>
<li>When everyone has had a turn, the combatant with the highest initiative acts again, and steps 4 and 5 repeat until combat ends.
</li>
</ol>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Combat_Round">The Combat Round</span></h3>
<p>Each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> represents 6 seconds in the game world. A <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> presents an opportunity for each character involved in a combat situation to take an action.
</p><p>Each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>’s activity begins with the character with the highest initiative result and then proceeds, in order, from there. Each <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> of a combat uses the same initiative order. When a character’s turn comes up in the initiative sequence, that character performs his entire <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>’s worth of actions. (For exceptions, see Attacks of Opportunity and Special Initiative Actions.)
</p><p>For almost all purposes, there is no relevance to the end of a <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> or the beginning of a <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. A <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> can be a segment of game time starting with the first character to act and ending with the last, but it usually means a span of time from one <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> to the same initiative count in the next <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>. Effects that last a certain number of rounds end just before the same initiative count that they began on.
