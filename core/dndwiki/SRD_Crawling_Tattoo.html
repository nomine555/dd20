<p><b>Crawling Tattoos:</b> Crawling tattoos resemble standard psionic tattoos, but their effects are often harmful rather than beneficial. Like a psionic tattoo, a crawling tattoo can be scribed only with a power of no higher than 3rd level that targets one or more creatures. Exceptions are the <i><a href="SRD_Body_Adjustment.html" title="SRD:Body Adjustment">body adjustment</a> </i>power, which can be scribed even though it affects only the manifester, and telepathy (compulsion) <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, which cannot be scribed at all. <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">Powers</a> that normally have an area affect only one target if scribed in a crawling tattoo. <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">Powers</a> with an experience point requirement cannot be scribed into a crawling tattoo. Otherwise, crawling tattoos are treated as psionic tattoos until they are activated by the wearer.
</p><p>The wearer of a crawling tattoo can tap the tattoo as a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> that provokes <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a>, mentally specifying a target (to which the wearer must have line of sight). Instead of manifesting its stored power, the tattoo animates, drops to the ground, and scuttles toward the target. The original wearer need no longer concentrate on the tattoo once animated.
</p><p>The animated tattoo moves toward its designated target in the same <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> when it is activated. Treat it as a Fine <a href="SRD_Construct_Type.html" title="SRD:Construct Type">construct</a> that has <a href="SRD_AC.html" title="SRD:AC" class="mw-redirect">AC</a> 18, 10 <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a>, a hardness of 5, speed 30 feet, and a bonus on <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack rolls</a> equal to the wearer’s <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a> + his <a href="SRD_Key_Ability.html" title="SRD:Key Ability" class="mw-redirect">key ability</a> modifier. Crawling tattoos, unlike true <a href="SRD_Construct_Type.html" title="SRD:Construct Type">constructs</a>, are subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and similar effects. Should the target be killed, teleport away, or otherwise absent itself before the animated tattoo reaches it, the wearer can reclaim the tattoo. If it is destroyed, a crawling tattoo shatters and evaporates.
</p><p>A crawling tattoo must enter the target’s square to attack and thus provokes <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a> as it passes through the target’s threatened area. The tattoo makes one <a href="SRD_Touch_Attack.html" title="SRD:Touch Attack" class="mw-redirect">touch attack</a> per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> thereafter until it strikes its target or is destroyed. On a successful attack, the power scribed in the crawling tattoo affects the target if the target fails the appropriate <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a>; however, <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> that normally allow a <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> automatically affect the touched target. Crawling tattoos can ferry beneficial <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> as well as harmful ones, and a target can allow the tattoo’s <a href="SRD_Touch_Attack.html" title="SRD:Touch Attack" class="mw-redirect">touch attack</a> to succeed if he or she desires.
</p><p>Two examples of crawling tattoos are described below; many more types are possible.
</p><p><i>Market Price: </i>The cost of a crawling tattoo depends on the level of the power scribed in it.
