<p>As a <a href="SRD_Full-Round_Actions.html" title="SRD:Full-Round Actions">full-round action</a>, a creature with this special attack can move up to twice its speed and literally run over any opponents at least one <a href="SRD_Size_Category.html" title="SRD:Size Category" class="mw-redirect">size category</a> smaller than itself. The creature merely has to move over the opponents in its path; any creature whose space is completely covered by the trampling creature’s space is subject to the trample attack. If a target’s space is larger than 5 feet, it is only considered trampled if the trampling creature moves over all the squares it occupies. If the trampling creature moves over only some of a target’s space, the target can make an <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attack of opportunity</a> against the trampling creature at a –4 penalty. A trampling creature that accidentally ends its movement in an illegal space returns to the last legal position it occupied, or the closest legal position, if there’s a legal position that’s closer.
</p><p>A trample attack deals bludgeoning damage (the creature’s slam damage + 1-1/2 times its <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Str</a> modifier). The creature’s descriptive text gives the exact amount.
</p><p>Trampled opponents can attempt <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a>, but these take a –4 penalty. If they do not make <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a>, trampled opponents can attempt <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> saves to take half damage.
</p><p>The save <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> against a creature’s trample attack is 10 + 1/2 creature’s <a href="SRD_Hit_Dice.html" title="SRD:Hit Dice" class="mw-redirect">HD</a> + creature’s <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Str</a> modifier (the exact <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> is given in the creature’s descriptive text). A trampling creature can only deal trampling damage to each target once per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature.
