<p>Barding is a type of armor that covers the head, neck, chest, body, and possibly legs of a horse or other mount. Barding made of medium or heavy armor provides better protection than light barding, but at the expense of speed. Barding can be made of any of the armor types found on Table: Armor and Shields.
</p><p>Armor for a horse (a Large nonhumanoid creature) costs four times as much as armor for a human (a Medium <a href="SRD_Humanoid_Type.html" title="SRD:Humanoid Type">humanoid</a> creature) and also weighs twice as much as the armor found on <a href="SRD_Armor.html" title="SRD:Armor">Table: Armor and Shields</a> (see <a href="SRD_Armor_for_Unusual_Creatures.html" title="SRD:Armor for Unusual Creatures">Armor for Unusual Creatures</a>). If the barding is for a pony or other Medium mount, the cost is only double, and the weight is the same as for Medium armor worn by a <a href="SRD_Humanoid_Type.html" title="SRD:Humanoid Type">humanoid</a>. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount that wears it, as shown on the table below.

<p>Flying mounts canâ€™t fly in medium or heavy barding.
</p><p>Removing and fitting barding takes five times as long as the figures given on <a href="SRD_Getting_Into_and_Out_of_Armor.html" title="SRD:Getting Into and Out of Armor">Table: Donning Armor</a>. A barded <a href="SRD_Animal_Type.html" title="SRD:Animal Type">animal</a> cannot be used to carry any load other than the rider and normal saddlebags.
