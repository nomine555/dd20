<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="dimensional-shackles">Dimensional Shackles</h1>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em> </p>
<p>You can use an action to place these shackles on an <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Incapacitated</a> creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don't prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.  <br/>
You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/strength/index.html">Strength</a> (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles. </p></div>
