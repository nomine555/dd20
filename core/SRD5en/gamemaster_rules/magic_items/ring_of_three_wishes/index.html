<p><em>Ring, legendary</em> </p>
<p>While wearing this ring, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 3 charges to cast the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/wish/index.html">Wish</a></em></strong> spell from it. The ring becomes nonmagical when you use the last charge. </p></div>
