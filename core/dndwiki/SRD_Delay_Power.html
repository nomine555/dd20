<p>To use this <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a>, you must expend your psionic focus. You can manifest a power as a delayed power. A delayed power doesn’t activate immediately. When you manifest the power, you choose one of three trigger mechanisms: (1) The power activates when you take a <a href="SRD_Standard_Actions.html" title="SRD:Standard Actions">standard action</a> to activate it; (2) It activates when a creature enters the area that the power will affect (only <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> that affect areas can use this trigger condition); or (3) It activates on your turn after 5 rounds pass. If you choose one of the first two triggers and the conditions are not met within 5 rounds, the power activates automatically on the fifth <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>.
</p><p>Only area and personal <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> can be delayed.
</p><p>Any decisions you would make about the delayed power, including <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack rolls</a>, designating targets, or determining or shaping an area, are decided when the power is manifested. Any effects resolved by those affected by the power, including <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throws</a>, are decided when the delay period ends.
</p><p>A delayed power can be dispelled normally during the delay, and can be detected normally in the area or on the target by the use of <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> that can detect psionic effects. 
</p><p>Using this <a href="SRD_Feats.html" title="SRD:Feats">feat</a> increases the <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power point</a> cost of the power by 2. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>.
