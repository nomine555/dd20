<p>You can use <i>dispel psionics </i>to end ongoing <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> that have been manifested on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the psionic abilities of a psionic item, or to end ongoing <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> (or at least their effects) within an area. A dispelled power ends as if its duration had expired. Some <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, as detailed in their descriptions, can’t be defeated by <i>dispel psionics, </i>or can be ended only if you manifest <i>dispel psionics </i>at a high enough <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>. <i>Dispel psionics </i>can end spell-like effects just as it does <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>.
</p><p>The effect of a power with an instantaneous duration can’t be dispelled, because the psionic effect is already over before the <i>dispel psionics </i>can take effect.
</p><p>You choose to use <i>dispel psionics </i>in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or an area dispel.
</p><p><i>Targeted Dispel: </i>One object, creature, or power is the target of the <i>dispel psionics </i>power. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>, maximum +10) against the power or against each ongoing power currently in effect on the object or creature. The <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> for this dispel check is 11 + the power’s <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>. If you succeed on a particular check, that power is dispelled; if you fail, that power remains in effect.
</p><p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power or is under the effect of an ongoing power, you make a dispel check to end the power or its effect. If the object that you target is a psionic item, you make a dispel check against the item’s <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>. If you succeed, all the item’s psionic properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonpsionic for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface is temporarily closed. A psionic item’s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed psionic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by
</p><p>mortal power such as this.
</p><p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any power that you manifested yourself.
</p><p><i>Area Dispel: </i>When <i>dispel psionics </i>is used in this way, the power affects everything within a 20-foot radius. For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, you make a dispel check against the power with the highest <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> until you dispel one power (which discharges the <i>dispel psionics </i>power so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature’s psionic items are not affected.
</p><p>For each object within the area that is the target of one or more <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Psionic items are not affected by an area dispel.
</p><p>For each ongoing area or effect power whose point of origin is within the area of the <i>dispel psionics </i>power, you can make a dispel check to dispel the power.
</p><p>For each ongoing power whose area overlaps that of the <i>dispel psionics </i>power, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
</p><p>If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the power that created that object or <a href="SRD_Construct_Type.html" title="SRD:Construct Type">construct</a> in addition to attempting to dispel <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> targeting the creature or object. You can choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any power that you have manifested.
</p><p><b><a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Augment" title="SRD:Augment" class="mw-redirect">Augment</a>:</b> For every additional <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power point</a> you spend, the bonus on your dispel check increases by 2 (to a maximum bonus of +20 for a 5-point expenditure).
