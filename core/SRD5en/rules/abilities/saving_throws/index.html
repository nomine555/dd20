<p>A saving throw--also called a save--represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm. <br/>
To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> modifier for a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/dexterity/index.html">Dexterity</a> saving throw. <br/>
A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a> and <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Disadvantage</a>, as determined by the GM.  <br/>
Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/intelligence/index.html">Intelligence</a> saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.  <br/>
The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/gamemaster_rules/monsters/index.html#spellcasting">Spellcasting</a> ability and proficiency bonus.  <br/>
The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.</p></div>
