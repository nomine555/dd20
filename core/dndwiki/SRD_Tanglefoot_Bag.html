<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tanglefoot_Bag">Tanglefoot Bag</span></h3>
<p>When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged <a href="SRD_Touch_Attack.html" title="SRD:Touch Attack" class="mw-redirect">touch attack</a> with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and the goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An <a href="SRD_Entangled.html" title="SRD:Entangled">entangled</a> creature takes a –2 penalty on <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack rolls</a> and a –4 penalty to <a href="SRD_Dexterity.html" title="SRD:Dexterity">Dexterity</a> and must make a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Reflex</a> save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.
</p><p>A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 17 <a href="SRD_Strength_Check.html" title="SRD:Strength Check" class="mw-redirect">Strength check</a> or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack roll</a>; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a <a href="SRD_Attack_Damage.html" title="SRD:Attack Damage">damage roll</a> to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by the goo must make a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration check</a> to cast a spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of <i><a href="SRD_Universal_Solvent.html" title="SRD:Universal Solvent">universal solvent</a></i> to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.
