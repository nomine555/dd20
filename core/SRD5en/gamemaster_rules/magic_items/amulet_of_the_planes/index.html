<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em> </p>
<p>While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/intelligence/index.html">Intelligence</a> check. On a successful check, you cast the <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/plane_shift/index.html">Plane Shift</a></em></strong> spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1–60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61–100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence. </p></div>
