<p><b>Bag of Holding:</b> This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The <i>bag of holding </i>opens into a nondimensional space: Its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount. This weight, and the limits in weight and volume of the bag’s contents, depend on the bag’s type, as shown on the table below.

<p>If the bag is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag ruptures and is ruined. All contents are lost forever. If a <i>bag of holding </i>is turned inside out, its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a <i>bag of holding </i>is a <a href="SRD_Move_Actions.html" title="SRD:Move Actions">move action</a>—unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a <a href="SRD_Full-Round_Actions.html" title="SRD:Full-Round Actions">full-round action</a>.
