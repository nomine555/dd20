<p><b>Gem of Brightness:</b> This crystal appears to be a long, rough prism. Upon utterance of a command word, the crystal emits bright light of one of three sorts.
</p>
<ul>
<li> One command word causes the gem to shed light as a hooded lantern. This use of the gem does not expend any charges.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Another command word causes the <i>gem of brightness </i>to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as a ranged <a href="SRD_Touch_Attack.html" title="SRD:Touch Attack" class="mw-redirect">touch attack</a>, and any creature struck by this beam is <a href="SRD_Blinded.html" title="SRD:Blinded">blinded</a> for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 14 <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although this glare lasts but a moment, any creature within the cone must make a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 14 <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="SRD_Blinded.html" title="SRD:Blinded">blinded</a> for 1d4 rounds. This use expends 5 charges.
</li>
</ul>
