<p>This ultrahard metal adds to the quality of a weapon or suit of armor. Weapons fashioned from adamantine have a natural ability to bypass hardness when sundering weapons or attacking objects, ignoring hardness less than 20. Armor made from adamantine grants its wearer damage reduction of 1/– if it’s light armor, 2/– if it’s medium armor, and 3/– if it’s heavy armor. Adamantine is so costly that weapons and armor made from it are always of masterwork quality; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below. Thus, adamantine weapons and ammunition have a +1 enhancement bonus on <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack rolls</a>, and the <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Armor_Check_Penalty" title="SRD:Armor Check Penalty" class="mw-redirect">armor check penalty</a> of adamantine armor is lessened by 1 compared to ordinary armor of its type. Items without metal parts cannot be made from adamantine. An arrow could be made of adamantine, but a quarterstaff could not.
</p><p>Only weapons, armor, and shields normally made of metal can be fashioned from adamantine. Weapons, armor and shields normally made of steel that are made of adamantine have one-third more <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> than normal. Adamantine has 40 <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> per inch of thickness and hardness 20.
