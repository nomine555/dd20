# RAID ON THE EMPEROR&#39;S HAND
This set piece encounter is designed to occur just after dawn as the
PCs’ ship is passing through an archipelago of sandy tropical isles.

As your ship rounds the coast line of the latest islet, a remarkable
scene comes into view. Ahead, sits an enormous five-masted merchant
vessel run aground and caught on a partially submerged sandbar. She
flies an Imperial flag and there are a large amount of figures milling
about agitatedly on her main deck. One of your ship’s lookouts gives a
cry, alerting you to three other ships visible in the distance, also
flying the same colors. These appear to be naval escort ships heading
for the beached merchant ship, but which are still some way off. The
stiff breeze is directly against these escorts, forcing them to tack
sharply to make progress.

The situation presents the PCs with a lucrative opportunity to attack
and raid the *Emperor’s Hand* while its escort ships are still out of
range. Once the PCs defeat the Hand’s leading officers, they have
limited time to search and plunder the ship of its most expensive cargo
before the PCs’ ship and crew come under heavy fire from the escorts.
The timing of the raid is critical, as is the PCs’ ability to quickly
identify the most valuable loot and then get it swiftly aboard their own
vessel.

# Background
The *Emperor’s Hand* recently completed a trading run to the southern
coast and is now returning home. While the ship is not fully laden, she
still carries an impressive amount of cargo, although much of this is in
bulky goods. Just before dawn this morning, the ship’s captain, Alban
Thekros, took over from the pilot at the helm. Alban had been drinking
heavily the night before and he continued to ease his hangover with
brandy from his hipflask while at the wheel. In spite of his rank,
Captain Thekros only has a basic proficiency in steering a ship this
size; he normally leaves tasks like this to his friend and first mate
Marten Furey. In the dim predawn light Alban misjudged how close a small
island was and ran the *Emperor’s Hand* aground on a shallow sandbar.
Fortunately, the ship wasn’t moving at any great speed so the structural
damage was minimal. Unfortunately in the confusion, neither Alban nor
any of those on deck thought to immediately signal the navy warships
that always accompany the *Emperor’s Hand*. These heavily armed escorts
have only just come about and are hastening to assist the ship and crew.



&gt;* A life spent at sea is a life of adventure even in the real world, and
in a fantasy campaign a voyage beyond the horizon brings dangers and
wonders undreamed of by those that never venture out of sight of land.
Of course, &quot;Here there be monsters&quot; is more than just a scrawled note on
a fragment of map when you sail the seven seas. However, the beauty of a
nautical campaign is also the way that every island you visit and every
stretch of open water in between can become its own unique location for
adventure. You&#39;re not camping out in town and heading down to the local
dungeon; you are setting sail on the lookout for long-buried riches,
with innovative encounters and exotic locales that will leave your
players relishing the discovery of the next treasure map that might lead
them onward toward the horizon. We hope they spice up your nautical
campaign with the rich story and background, innovative layout,
beautiful aesthetics, and excellence in design that is the hallmark of
Legendary Games. We hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed making
it. Game on!

# THE SHIP
The sandbar’s shallows extend for some distance around the stranded
ship. However, the Hand is a deep-drafted ship and the water level
nearby sufficient for the PCs’ vessel to approach to within 50 feet,
assuming their vessel is a typical sailing ship or smaller craft. The
PCs can attempt a DC 16 *Wisdom* (Perception or Nature) check to identify
this safe distance, or use an aquatic scout with a *Swim* speed of at
least 30 ft. to reconnoiter. The PCs can also take depth soundings as
they approach, but the additional time needed to do this slows the
attack. The *Hand* sits in about 8 feet of water, allowing the PCs and
their crew to use their ship’s longboats to row up to the *Hand*. Of
course, high level PCs are likely to also have magical means to board
the *Emperor’s Hand*. The Hand tilts at a slight angle, but not enough
to hamper movement on her decks. The tide is rising and the high tide
will allow the Hand to float off the sand bar.

&gt;* **Lots of plunder!**
&gt;* The idea behind this encounter is to allow pirate PCs to take on a
target that would normally be out of their league, but not have them
acquire so much treasure that they would want to retire! The threat of
the three escort ships should discourage the PCs from trying to pick the
*Emperor’s Hand* clean. If the PCs insist on trying to take on the
escorts, give the PCs fair warning and have these ships start by
seriously damaging the PCs’ ship with catapult rocks and killing several
of their crew with barrages of ballista bolts. Even if the PCs do
somehow win this overwhelming encounter, chances are they are likely to
lose both their ship and much of their crew in the process.

## Ship Combat
When the *Emperor’s Hand* becomes aware of the PCs’ ship, the Hand’s
officers order gunners to their stations on the battle deck. However,
unless the PCs choose to expose their ship to broadsides from the
Hand’s impressive ballista arsenal by sailing to the Hand’s port
side, they only face the two forward facing ballistae and the catapult
mounted on the forecastle as the PCs’ ship closes in on its prey. As the
Hand is immobile, it makes an easy target: the ship has an effective
Dexterity of 0 (–5 penalty to AC), and an additional –2 penalty to its
AC.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Ransacking the Hand" tags="encounter @ransacking-the-hand" position="525,413" size="100,100">
# RANSACKING THE HAND

Rather than force the PCs to explore and search every nook and cranny of
the Hand while counting out every combat round and every 5 foot square,
have the PCs move through various areas of the vessel while you describe
smashing open doors, grabbing handfuls of loot, and fighting the
disorganized defenders.

Use the table below as a guide to determine how many areas the PCs can
search before the escort ships get too close. It’s likely the PCs’ crew
are also plundering the *Emperor’s Hand* at the same time but their crew
might miss some of the less obvious but still portable treasures aboard.

| Condition                                                                                                                                                                     | Number of Areas |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| PCs defeat the captain and first mate in 3 rounds or less                                                                                                                     | 8               |
| PCs defeat the captain and first mate in 5 rounds or less                                                                                                                     | 7               |
| PCs defeat the captain and first mate in 8 rounds or less                                                                                                                     | 6               |
| PCs defeat the captain and first mate in 10 rounds or more                                                                                                                    | 5               |
| PC *Slow* their attack to take depth soundings                                                                                                                                  | –1              |
| For every 8 *Emperor’s Hand* crewmembers the PCs defeat or capture before starting to ransack the ship (the gunnery vanguard troop counts as 16 crewmembers for this purpose) | +1              |

Allow for creative ideas and clever tactics the players come up with.
Anything that allows the PCs to quickly rout the defenders or unusual
ways to swiftly inspect an area could give the PCs the extra time needed
to search an additional area or two. The PCs can retry a failed skill
check in an area but this counts as searching the area again. Only some
areas of the *Hand* have a Ransack section and a DC 20 Wisdom
(Perception) check in an area with no Ransack section reveals that there
is no hidden plunder to be had there.

Note: Even with their entire crew helping, the PCs cannot steal
everything on the *Hand* in the time they have. It’s already assumed
that during the PCs’ search of ship’s areas that they, or their crew,
are taking the obvious valuables. The checks the PCs can make in certain
areas of the *Hand* represent the potential of finding hidden, yet
easily transportable plunder that might otherwise be missed. Even if the
PCs say, “we take everything” in an area, the time wasted taking low
quality goods and furnishings simply counteracts any bonus they might
gain by inadvertently taking an area’s Ransacking bonus items as part of
a blanket attempt to ‘grab everything’.

## The Ransacking Check

A ransacking check determines how much booty the PCs are able to plunder
in total and how valuable it is. Have the PCs search through the
calculated number of areas (referring to [[The Emperor’s Hand]] section), where they can take a variety of actions and make skill
checks to gain bonuses to the ransacking check. Then only when the PCs
are safe and their ship is clear of the escort ships have them roll the
ransacking check to see how much they got away with. This ransacking
check also has the following modifiers:

| Amount of crew\*                                                                                                                 | Modifier |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| The PCs have all or nearly all their crew searching and plundering (leaving at most only a couple of lookouts on their own ship) | +6       |
| The PCs have around two-thirds of their crew searching and plundering (leaving a *Skeleton* crew on their ship)                    | +4       |
| The PCs have a boarding party of around a third of their crew searching and plundering                                           | +0       |
| The PCs are searching and plundering by themselves                                                                               | –8       |

\* Use your discretion as GM with this. For example, if the PCs
initially attack with only a small boarding party, but then order the
rest of their crew to lower longboats and row over (which takes some
time and most likely requires several trips) you could treat this as the
PCs having two-thirds of their crew plundering.

## Extradimensional Storage

If the PCs have a magic item with extradimensional space to store and
transport plunder, see the chart below for handling some options. This
assumes that the storage item is initially empty and the PCs fill the
item with booty and transfer it to their ship multiple times during the
plundering. For example:

| Item              | Modifier\* |
|-------------------|------------|
| *bag of holding*  | +2         |
| *handy haversack* | +1         |
| *portable hole*   | +5         |

\* A generous GM might allow the PCs to total all their extradimensional
space items together before calculating the total bonus.

## Magic

If the PCs make use of spells that shrink their plunder or make it
easier to transport, add a bonus to the ransacking check equal to half
the spell’s level. When calculating this bonus, round up or round down
depending on precisely how useful the spell is. For example:

| Spell            | Modifier |
|------------------|----------|
| *floating disk*  | +1       |
| *enlarge/reduce* | +2       |

Note: The *floating disk* spell is great for carrying items of plunder
while moving through the decks of the *Hand*, but the spell’s range
limitation may make transporting the treasure on the disk over to the
PCs’ ship problematic.

## Moving the Loot

After gathering plunder, the PCs and their crew need to quickly
transport it across the gap between the *Hand* and their own ship. Using
boats is *Slow* and limits the amount of plunder that can be taken in each
trip. However, as long as the PCs are using at least three boats (a
combination of their own and those from the *Hand*) then the process is
still relatively effective. For each boat less than three that is used,
apply a –4 penalty to the PCs’ ransacking check.

Setting up a rope line between the two ships and winching plunder across
is possible, a DC 14 *Wisdom* (Survival) check can achieve this quickly
enough to be useful. Add a +2 bonus to the ransacking check if the PCs
implement this idea, providing the two ships remain a consistent
distance apart throughout the process.

Flying or other magical forms of movement can help. A flying creature
ferrying piles of plunder over to the PCs’ ship gives a bonus equal to
half the creature’s *Strength* modifier to the ransacking check.
Additionally, add a +1 bonus if the creature is a quadruped or otherwise
suited to carrying heavy loads, and *Advantage* if the creature is Large
or larger.

Swimming creatures can also be of some use, but the problem of getting
the plunder down to a swimming creature and then back up on deck at the
PCs’ ship means that unless the swimming creature can also quickly climb
up and down from the upper deck level as well, their contribution is
limited compared to that of a flying creature. Calculate a swimming
creature bonus as a flying creature but then halve the result.

The PCs can use magic to *Fly* or improve their carrying capacity and as
long as these effects last 5 minutes or more they are effective, adding
the increased bonuses and effects into the calculations above.

Teleportation magic is another way to quickly move from the Hand to the
PCs’ ship. Add a bonus equal to half the spell’s level for effects that
move the caster and at least 2 other Medium-sized creatures to the PCs’
ship (such as a *dimension door* or a *teleport*). Give a smaller bonus
(most likely only +1) for teleportation effects that only move a single
creature.

Finally have one character, usually the captain of the PCs’ ship, make
the Ransacking check. This is an Intillegence check with up to three
additional characters able to use the Help action on this check, each
success granting the character making the check the normal +2 bonus. Use
the following table to determine the value of the PCs’ plunder from the
*Emperor’s Hand*:



| Total ransacking check result | Plunder acquired |
|-----|----|
| 16 or less | 1,000 gp |
| 17-20 | 1,500 gp |
| 21-24 | 2,000 gp |
| 25-28 | 2,500 gp |
| 29-32 | 3,000 gp |
| 33-36 | 3,500 gp |
| 37-40 | 4,000 gp |
| 41-44 | 4,500 gp |
| 45-48 | 6,000 gp |
| 49 or more  * | 7,000 gp |




\* This assumes that the PCs’ ship is filled to capacity with plunder
from the *Emperor’s Hand.*

**Story Award**: If the PCs are able to gain a +15 bonus to their
Ransacking check from their actions while searching areas of the Hand
award them 3,200 XP.

**Development**: Once the PCs run out of time searching the Emperor’s
Hand, they hear shouts from their crew as a catapult stone from one of
the escorts splashes into the water close to their ship. The PCs can
choose to search one more area, but start rolling attack rolls for the
catapults and ballistae onboard the escorts against the PCs’ ship and
crew. Any further delay after this is suicidal as the PCs’ ship won’t
have time to get underway with enough speed to outrun the imperial
escorts.

# CONCLUSION

Whether you choose to play out the ship-to-ship combat between the PCs’
ship and the escorts using ship combat rules or resolve the PCs’ escape
with a series of opposed *Wisdom* (Survival) checks is up to you as GM.
The PCs now certainly have something to brag about when they sell their
plunder in their next port of call, being the only pirates ever who have
successfully raided the *Emperor’s Hand*!

# ALL ABOARD (XP: 14,600)

* *Alban Thekros*
* *Marten Furey*
* *Gunnery Vanguard*

The construction of the massive ship named the *Emperor’s Hand* was a
measured risk by the crown of the decadent failing Empire, the cost
considerably eroding the already low royal coffers. However, the ship
quickly paid for itself, as it became a status symbol for those within
the Empire who wish to quickly move large amounts of goods or transport
extremely bulky objects. With the potential for so much cargo, the
*Hand* has come under attack by pirates several times, but currently
none have survived the encounter.

One of the largest ships afloat on the charted ocean, the *Emperor’s
Hand* has five masts allowing its square rigged sails to propel the
Hand at great speed when running before the wind. From bow to stern,
these masts are called: the fore mast, the main mast, the mizzen mast,
the bonaventure mizzen, and the jigger mast. It counts as a sailing
ship.


## Boarding Stations!
Depending on the PCs’ tactics, the captain, first mate, and a contingent
of ship’s gunners make a stand against the PCs’ boarding party on the
main deck. If the Hand comes under significant ranged fire or damaging
area effect spells, Captain Alban Thekros orders all hands below decks,
planning to fight the enemy at close quarters between the decks before
they can get to the valuables in the ship’s hold.

### Development
When *Captain Thekros* is defeated, the Hand’s crew
nearby loses heart and surrenders. However, knowing that their
compatriots are coming to rescue them, other small pockets of resistance
still fight on in the lower decks, hampering the PCs’ efforts to quickly
plunder the ship. The PCs may think to take some of the Hand’s officers
captive for ransom, but both Alban and Marten have most of their
personal wealth tied up in the Hand and her cargo. Only after much
negotiation do the PCs receive a ransom of 500 gp each for Alban and
Marten. Having Alban or Marten onboard the PCs’ ship and making their
presence known to the escorts does mean that while the escort furiously
chase them, they hold off on attacks with their siege weapons. Throwing
these hostages overboard while being pursued is a sure way to delay the
escorts as the imperial ships are compelled to slow and pick their
officers up.



AT A GLANCE
---
* *Detect magic*:
 * There is nothing magical. 
* *Detect evil and good*:
 * There are not aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead creatures.
 * There are not places or objects that has been magically consecrated or desecrated. 

CONCLUSION
---
Depending on how the players approach the Hand, they may start with one of those:
* [[Upper deck]].  
* [[Forecastle and Sterncastle Interior]].  
* [[Battle Deck]].  
* [[Berth Deck]].  
* [[Orlop Deck]].  
* [[Hold]].

# SCALING THE ADVENTURE

While Raid on the *Emperor’s Hand* is designed for 8th level characters,
it can easily be scaled if the GM feels that the PCs will find the
adventure too hard or too easy. Also, some groups of PCs are likely to
want to have to fight their way down each deck in an extended series of
battles to secure the *Emperor’s Hand*, rather than simply forcing a
surrender by defeating the ship’s captain.

## Scale down
Have Marten arrive on the top deck two rounds after the PCs start fighting the captain.

## Scale up
Use the following NPCs to provide support for Alban and
Marten during the initial battle on deck and have Alban and Marten
retreat below deck when they are reduced below half hit points. Also,
have a second gunnery troop assemble on the berth deck to defend the
ship. If the troop has time, they make their way to the battle deck and
reposition many of the ballistae to fire at the entranceways down from
the top deck.

# Ship’s Priests

The two ship’s priests, named Malthin and Cersia, both worship the god
of cities and wealth, and they have received ample remuneration for
their term of service onboard the *Hand*. Replace the two healers in
area 22 with these two clerics.

*Imperial Priests*





# Ship’s Sorcerer: Galtus Ossian

Galtus Ossian serves as a Master on the *Emperor’s Hand*. With the sea
in his blood, Galtus expects to spend the rest of his career on the

# WELCOME, ADVENTURER
You have in your hands a **Tabletop RPG** adventure designed to be mastered from a tablet.
This is a medieval-fantasy adventure that uses *SRD5 System* and can be adapted to any game world.

## What is a roleplaying game?
Roleplaying games consist of taking on roles, usually in fantasy worlds. You have to imagine how your adventurer would face the challenges presented by the game’s director. You play sitting around a table with your friends, with a few dice and ready to have a good time.

## What do I need to play?
To play this adventure, you need to be familiarized with the *SRD5 System* and have dice and a pencil and paper. **The adventure itself gives you the necessary rules to resolve each encounter**. You will also need character sheets.

You can read a [synopsis of the adventure](./index.html?param=@summary) or go directly to [Ransacking the Hand](./index.html?param=@ransacking-the-hand).

## How does GameThrough work?
*GameThrough* divides the adventure’s content into encounters and scenes. The difference between encounters and scenes is only from the point of view of the story. In the encounters, a concrete situation is resolved - for example, a battle or an investigation - while the scenes describe more open-ended situations, such as exploring a city. Encounters and scenes are linked depending on players’ decisions. In the bottom left you will always find the *GameThrough* menu.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/summary/gamethrough.jpg&quot; class=&quot;icons-center&quot;&gt;

### Encounters and Scenes
On the left, you will have three tabs (At a glance, Body, Conclusion) and the icons with illustrations, maps, enemies and music.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/summary/gamethrough-2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;icons-center&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* **At a  glance**, describes what the characters can see in the encounter, using their skills.

* **Body**, is the default tab with links to illustrations, enemies, maps and music.

* **Conclusion**, describes the consequences of the characters’ actions. 

* On the right, you will find the text for the encounter or scene. 

### GameThrough Bar
The *GameThrough* bar offers four indexes so you can move around in the adventure. Each index corresponds to one of the following icons:
&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-1.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to the adventure’s classic index.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-2.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to a map with all the adventure’s locations &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-3.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to a list of all the non-player characters relevant to the adventure. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-4.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; This icon will take you to a time diagram of the adventure. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;overflow:hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-izquierda.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;../core/images/icons/icon-index-derecha.png&quot; class=&quot;icons-left-small&quot;&gt; With these icons, you will be able to navigate around the encounters you have already visited. &lt;/div&gt;

### Indexed rules
All the rules you need to resolve the adventure’s situations will appear on the left-hand side of the screen when you click on one of the [red links](#) or on *italics*.

## ALBAN THEKROS
![medium](./images/alban.jpg)
Born the illegitimate son of the head of a major noble house, Alban
Thekros was raised at a cloister devoted to the goddess of valor. He
found out his heritage while still a small child and dreamed while
growing up of one day being acknowledged as a dignified and powerful
aristocrat. He has ambitiously spent much of his youthful life seeking a
way to obtain his own *Noble* title to receive what he considers his
birthright. Incredibly gifted at swordplay and with a passing fancy for
sailing, Alban leapt at the opportunity when it was announced that the
Emperor sought a talented sea captain for a new government-sponsored
merchant vessel. He considers this position a significant step on the
way to achieving his lifelong ambition as well as the lands and riches
that go with it. A flamboyant fellow, Alban dresses in loose silk shirts
accented with stylish jewelry while onboard ship.

***Sneak Attack.*** Once per turn, Alban deals an extra 21 (6d6) damage
when he hits a target with a weapon attack and has *Advantage* on the

## MARTEN FUREY
![medium](./images/marten.jpg)
A waif who never knew his parents, Marten Furey grew up in a cloister
orphanage with Alban Thekros as his childhood playmate. When Marten and
Alban reached adulthood, they each sought different paths, Marten
joining the Imperial Army and then the Navy, learning the trades of
guardian, marine, scout, and seafarer, but both young men remained very
close friends. Now having rejoined forces to take *Command* of the
prestigious *Emperor’s Hand*, Marten happily serves as Alban’s first
mate and bodyguard. An accomplished warrior in his own right, Marten
tends to wear heavier armor and take blows aimed at his captain.

### Marten Furey, First Mate

provoke attacks of opportunity from that creature for the rest of the

# UPPER DECK

**1. Main Deck**: The long main deck of this mighty ship easily has room
for a 30-foot cutter secured upside down to protect it from the
elements, in addition to six ship’s boats. There is a massive cargo
hatch between the main mast and mizzen mast, and another smaller hatch
between the mizzen mast and the bonaventure mizzen. Both have crane-like
contrivances next to them to *Aid* in getting heavy cargo into and out of
the ship’s hold.

*Ransack:* The *Hand*’s fire-resistant, magically-treated silk sails are
valuable to any ship and easily saleable once any imperial emblems are
removed. A DC 15 *Intelligence* (Arcana) check or *detect magic* spell
reveals their value. It requires a DC 20 *Wisdom* (Survival) check
utilizing at least one third of the PCs’ crew to remove sufficient sail
cloth from the *Hand*’s masts to gain a +4 bonus to the Ransacking
check. A successful DC 13 *Intelligence* check enables the PCs to figure
out how to use the cranes to get piles of plunder up on deck quickly.
This grants a +3 bonus to the Ransacking check. The PCs can also make
use of the Hand’s boats to transport their loot to their own ship if
they lack sufficient boats of their own.

**2. Bow**: This open area at the front of the ship allows access to the
bowsprit and ship’s figurehead, a carving of the Emperor wearing his
full regalia with one arm dramatically outstretched. To either side of
the ladders down from the forecastle are areas for storage of the ship’s
two anchors and anchor chains.

**3. Forecastle Deck**: This raised deck has a platform-mounted light
catapult in the center of the deck that can be rotated and fired in any
direction. (Although the Hand’s masts and rigging are in the way of
sternward shots.) There are capstans to either side of the catapult
which raise the Hand’s two anchors.

**4. Sterncastle Deck**: The ship’s wheel is at the fore of this deck in
front of the jigger mast. Similar to the forecastle, this deck has a
platform-mounted light catapult similar to the one on the forecastle
deck.


AT A GLANCE
---
* *Detect magic*:
 * The Hand’s fire-resistant, magically-treated silk sails are
valuable to any ship and easily saleable once any imperial emblems are
removed.
* *Detect evil and good*:
 * There are not aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead creatures.
 * There are not places or objects that has been magically consecrated or desecrated. 

CONCLUSION
---
From here, characters can move to:
* [[Forecastle and Sterncastle Interior]].
* [[Battle Deck]].

# FORECASTLE AND STERNCASTLE INTERIOR

These two sections have large cabins for guests and the higher ranking
ship’s officers.

**5. Forward Cabin**: This well-furnished room functions as a guest
chamber for paying passengers or as servants’ quarters when the forward
stateroom is occupied by a powerful aristocrat.

**6. Forward Stateroom**: This opulent chamber serves as guest quarters
for any high-ranking noble who wishes to travel aboard the Hand.
Paintings of seascapes and noble imperial explorers decorate the walls
and a long mahogany table takes up the center of the room. A large teak
cabinet sits in one corner, and a lavish four-poster bed rests near a
glass-framed window.

*Ransack:* Many of the smaller furnishings are valuable, but a DC 16
*Intelligence* (History) check or a character proficient with painter’s
supplies picks out one of the smaller, less extravagant paintings as
being the work of an obscure imperial master; it is worth more than all
the larger works combined. Taking this painting gives a +3 bonus to the
Ransacking check.

**7. First Mate’s Cabin**: This cabin belongs to Marten Furey, first
mate of the *Emperor’s Hand*. The place is militarily tidy and the desk
has a few papers including a journal of Marten’s journeys onboard the
Hand. This journal provides details from the adventure background as
well as Marten’s and Alban’s personal backgrounds. At the GM’s
discretion, the journal could also contain valuable secrets such as
details of Empirical shipping schedules that can be exploited by the
PCs.

**8. Senior Officers’ Quarters**: Each of these private quarters can be
locked with a simple lock (AC 14, 10 hp, immune to poison &amp; psychic
damage) and has a bunk and a desk for storing personal effects. A
character using thieves&#39; tools can try to pick a lock, which requires 2
turns and a successful DC 18 *Dexterity* check.

*Ransack:* Searching all three officer’s quarters only counts as
searching one area. In the quartermaster’s cabin (**8a**) there is a
hidden cache of pearls worth a +3 bonus to the Ransacking check, which
can be found with a DC 24 *Wisdom* (Perception) check.

**8a. Quartermaster’s Cabin**: This cabin has the small luxury of a
large porthole to let fresh air in. The quartermaster bunks here.

**8b. Masters’ Quarters**: This cabin has two beds and the master gunner
and sailing master bunk here.

**8c. Boatswain’s Quarters**: These quarters have a little extra room in
the form of a large closet. The Hand’s current cabin boy (secretly the
boatswain’s cousin) has set up a sleep pallet in the closet.

**9. Captain’s Lounge**: This sumptuous room is where the captain has
dinner parties with guests, holds meetings with his senior officers, and
performs much of the paperwork that comes with being an imperial ship’s
captain. A polished hardwood table dominates the center of the room and
a cupboard holds fine porcelain dishes and silverware. A long closet
stores a cluttered collection of trade ledgers, maps, paperwork, and a
number of bottles of imperial brandy.

*Ransack:* Among the clutter in the closet there are many nautical
charts, but a DC 20 *Wisdom* (Perception) check followed by a DC 16 Wisdom
(Survival) check recognizes part of a detailed but unlabeled old and
worn map as part of the coastline of the southern continent. Marked on
it are several small islands and even a city unknown to modern sailors.
Notes on the map claim it is a copy of a copy but even still, it can be
sold for a substantial price giving the PCs a +3 bonus on the Ransacking
check.

**10. Captain’s Cabin**: This large luxuriously appointed cabin has a
large double bed in the corner and four large glass windows offer views
astern of the ship. A polished marble table sits in the middle of the
room and a small door to one side reveals a sizable wardrobe of
clothing.

*Ransack:* While most of the wealth here is openly on display, a DC 15
Intelligence (History) check notices a small bronze plaque with the
imperial seal. Only the hand of the Emperor himself can give this mark
of distinction and even a stolen one is worth a significant amount: add
a +1 bonus to the Ransacking check.

# BERTH DECK

This deck contains the crew’s quarters, ship’s supplies, and
quartermaster’s store. It continues the series of hatches for getting
heavy cargo to the reinforced hold below.

**12. Gunners’ Quarters**: Lines of hammocks hang between support poles
crowding this large crew quarters. The ship’s gunners rest and sleep
here.

**13. Main Crew Quarters**: The two cargo hatches take up the center of
this area leaving only limited room for hammocks around the edges. Piles
of sleeping pallets are stacked to either side of the stairs at the aft
of the room.

**14. Galley**: A long bench between the two doorways on the port side
of this cooking area allows for fast service of food to the large crew.

**15. Quartermaster’s Workroom**: This workshop contains benches and
shelves holding wood and metalworking tools used to repair the ship.

**16: Ships Stores**: This room contains spare seafaring equipment and
raw materials to repair or manufacture replacements for lost or broken
ship’s gear.

**17: Larder**: Fruit, fresh food, water, and other perishables are
stored here.

**18: Food Stores**: Barrels and sealed containers hold salted meat and
other preserved foodstuffs here.

*Ransack:* A DC 25 *Intelligence* (Investigation) check finds a stash of narcotics hidden in the bottom of a small cask of dried peppers. This adds a +4 bonus to the Ransacking check.

**19: Grog Storage**: This small space in the innards of the ship holds
supplies of wine, rum, and other drink. The door is locked (AC 16 14 hp,
immune to poison &amp; psychic damage) but several of the ship’s officers
have the key. A character using thieves&#39; tools can try to pick a lock,
which requires 3 turns and a successful DC 20 *Dexterity* check.

*Ransack:* Anyone proficient with the brewer’s supplies or a DC 15
*Intelligence* check reveals bottles of potent and valuable liquor in one
corner worth +2 to the Ransacking check.

**20: Armory**: Rows of well-oiled weapons and trunks of armament for
the crew fill this curved room.

*Ransack:* A DC 16 *Wisdom* (Perception) check or a character proficient
with smith’s tools turns up a stockpile of excellent weapons at the back
of a weapon’s locker. This adds +2 to the PCs’ ransacking check.

# BATTLE DECK

This deck holds much of the ship’s armament.

**11. Battle Deck**: There are 26 ballistae here, 11 each side running
the length of the ship for its powerful broadsides and pairs of
ballistae facing both forward and aft as chasers. In between the masts
are large trunks that hold reserves of ballista bolts and other ship’s
munitions.

**11a. Whipstaff Steerage Assembly**: Behind paneled partitions is a
series of chains, fulcrums, and other apparatus designed to transfer the
force from turn of the ship’s wheel to the Hand’s massive tiller.

# ORLOP DECK

This deck is half under the water line when the ship is unladen and
beneath the water line when fully laden.

**21: Petty Officers’ Quarters**: These quarters offer some privacy and
slightly more room for the ship’s junior officers. The hammocks are more
comfortable and have more room between them.

&gt;* If you are scaling the adventure up, include this character in this area:
&gt;* *Galtus Ossian*

**22: Surgeon and Carpenter’s Quarters**: This cramped area holds bunks
and sleeping pallets for the Hand’s surgeon, healers, and master
carpenter. The two ship’s healers are non-combatant clerics (stats as a
*Commoner* but with a *Wisdom* of 15) but can use their spells and
channeling to heal some of the captain’s or crew’s wounds if they
retreat here.

***Spellcasting***. The clerics are 3rd-level spellcasters. They’re
spellcasting ability is *Wisdom* (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell
attacks). The clerics have the following spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): *light*, *mending*, *resistance*

1st level (4 slots): *cure wounds*, *healing word*, *inflict wounds*

2nd level (2 slots): *hold person*, *silence*

&gt;* If you are scaling the adventure up, replace the two healers in
area 22 with these two clerics.
&gt;* *Imperial Priests*

**23: Infirmary**: Two cots and a table for treating patients furnish
this room as well as a large cabinet of medical supplies.

*Ransack:* A successful DC 20 *Wisdom* (Medicine) check identifies
valuable healing herbs and medicines as well as sets of excellently made
medical tools. This adds a +1 bonus to the Ransacking check. Also, a DC
25 *Wisdom* (Perception) check or detecting magic in this area reveals a
hidden reserve of healing potions and alchemical antidotes worth a +2
bonus to the Ransacking check.

**24: Cargo Storage**: Bulkheads partition this large area giving the
ship extra structural support and providing additional means of securing
cargo to prevent slippage in rough seas. The area currently holds hides
and furs from the tropical south, a huge shipment of fibrous jute, and a
large quantity of grain. Buried in among these bulk goods are more
valuable commodities, including several crates of ivory, reams of fine
cloth, well-sealed containers of salt, and cases of tobacco.

*Ransack:* PCs can make four DC 18 *Wisdom* (Perception) checks to find
the valuable commodities, with each successful check adding a +1 bonus
to the Ransacking check (maximum of a +4 bonus). A DC 20 *Wisdom*
(Survival) check also finds a selection of high-quality furs in the
midst of some unexceptional hides giving a +3 bonus to the Ransacking
check.

**25: Private Storeroom**: The cargo doors to this area are locked (AC
15, 20 hp, immune to poison &amp; psychic damage). A character using
thieves&#39; tools can try to pick a lock, which requires 4 turns and a
successful DC 25 *Dexterity* check. The only key is in the captain’s
cabin. This storeroom is used to transport important merchandise
directly for the crown or for highly confidential cargoes, but is
currently empty.

*Ransack:* If the PCs spend more than 1–1/2 minutes breaking into this
area, then this counts toward the number of areas they can search.
Otherwise, they search this area for free, but find nothing that helps
with the Ransacking check.

music {heroicdemise.mp3}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Hold" tags="encounter @hold" position="1759,587" size="100,100">
# HOLD

This hold is under the water line, even when the ship is completely
unladen.

**26: Brig/Secure Compartments**: These two small compartments in the
bowels of the ship have reinforced doors set with heavy bars and solid
locks leading into each of them. A small metal grille set in each door
allows observation from the outside. Both doors are currently unlocked.
Designed to hold prisoners or punish sailors, the compartments can also
serve as secure storage areas. Both compartments have piles of rough
bedding and the starboard one holds an impressive amount of broken
furnishings, discarded empty boxes, and other junk.

*Ransack:* A DC 20 *Wisdom* (Perception) check turns up a heavy chest
buried under the junk in the starboard compartment. This is the Hand’s
pay chest concealed here by one of the senior officers while the PCs’
ship approached. It is worth a +6 bonus to the Ransacking check.

**27: Main Hold**: This area is reserved for ballast and the heaviest
cargo which helps keep the ship stable in even the worst storms. Even
when not carrying cargo, the sheer size of the ship makes it very
difficult to capsize. The forward storage area holds spare ship’s
supplies and basic materials used to maintain the hand. The cargo here
consists of iron and copper ingots, lumber, stone bricks, and barrels of
tar and pitch.

*Ransack:* A DC 16 *Intelligence* (Nature) check can identify the rarer woods adding a +2 bonus to the Ransacking check and a character
proficient with alchemist’s supplies reveals high quality oils worth a
+3 bonus to the Ransacking check.

## Bilges

Since the *King&#39;s Hand* is still a new ship, the bilges are not yet as
unpleasant as other ships. Having been properly built and sealed, there
is very little leakage and the size of the ship means there is usually
only a couple of inches of water. In the center of the bilges is a large
pump next to stairs leading up to the cargo hold.

# Ship&#39;s Gunner (60)
&gt;* SWARM OF SOLDIERS?!
&gt;* Having the group of soldiers that fight with Captain Alban and Marten
Furey statted up as a swarm alleviates some of the issues of having a
large amount of low level NPCs in a higher level encounter. It speeds up
combat because the GM doesn’t have to make dozens of attack rolls every
round and makes the gunnery vanguard group a more appropriately
challenging opposition for high level PCs. Note that is using
miniatures, the swarm can exist in any contiguous configuration, not
just 4x4. The attacks represent a disciplined crew’s many attacks during
a round as swords slash and crossbow bolts *Fly* overhead, not just one
sword attack. However, as a GM you should be wary of having this group
attack or interact with the PCs’ crew of lower level NPCs. This is
because the group is essentially the equivalent of a **CR 8 swarm** and
can easily kill multiple lower level characters, which is unfair to the
PCs’ crew, unless you convert them into a swarm as well. Use the
individual ship’s gunner and sailors stat blocks (below) if you need to
play out a fight between members of the two crews.

it isn’t worn or carried.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Upper Deck Map" tags="lugares @upper-deck-map" position="1108,455" size="100,100">
# Main Deck
The long main deck of this mighty ship easily has room
for a 30-foot cutter secured upside down to protect it from the
elements, in addition to six ship’s boats. There is a massive cargo
hatch between the main mast and mizzen mast, and another smaller hatch
between the mizzen mast and the bonaventure mizzen. Both have crane-like
contrivances next to them to *Aid* in getting heavy cargo into and out of
the ship’s hold.

*Ransack:* The *Hand*’s fire-resistant, magically-treated silk sails are
valuable to any ship and easily saleable once any imperial emblems are
removed. A DC 15 *Intelligence* (Arcana) check or *detect magic* spell
reveals their value. It requires a DC 20 *Wisdom* (Survival) check
utilizing at least one third of the PCs’ crew to remove sufficient sail
cloth from the *Hand*’s masts to gain a +4 bonus to the Ransacking
check. A successful DC 13 *Intelligence* check enables the PCs to figure
out how to use the cranes to get piles of plunder up on deck quickly.
This grants a +3 bonus to the Ransacking check. The PCs can also make
use of the Hand’s boats to transport their loot to their own ship if
they lack sufficient boats of their own.

# Bow
This open area at the front of the ship allows access to the
bowsprit and ship’s figurehead, a carving of the Emperor wearing his
full regalia with one arm dramatically outstretched. To either side of
the ladders down from the forecastle are areas for storage of the ship’s
two anchors and anchor chains.

# Forecastle Deck
This raised deck has a platform-mounted light
catapult in the center of the deck that can be rotated and fired in any
direction. (Although the Hand’s masts and rigging are in the way of
sternward shots.) There are capstans to either side of the catapult
which raise the Hand’s two anchors.

# Sterncastle Deck
The ship’s wheel is at the fore of this deck in
front of the jigger mast. Similar to the forecastle, this deck has a
platform-mounted light catapult similar to the one on the forecastle
deck.

# Forward Cabin
This well-furnished room functions as a guest
chamber for paying passengers or as servants’ quarters when the forward
stateroom is occupied by a powerful aristocrat.

# Forward Stateroom
This opulent chamber serves as guest quarters
for any high-ranking noble who wishes to travel aboard the Hand.
Paintings of seascapes and noble imperial explorers decorate the walls
and a long mahogany table takes up the center of the room. A large teak
cabinet sits in one corner, and a lavish four-poster bed rests near a
glass-framed window.

*Ransack:* Many of the smaller furnishings are valuable, but a DC 16
*Intelligence* (History) check or a character proficient with painter’s
supplies picks out one of the smaller, less extravagant paintings as
being the work of an obscure imperial master; it is worth more than all
the larger works combined. Taking this painting gives a +3 bonus to the
Ransacking check.

# First Mate’s Cabin
This cabin belongs to Marten Furey, first
mate of the *Emperor’s Hand*. The place is militarily tidy and the desk
has a few papers including a journal of Marten’s journeys onboard the
Hand. This journal provides details from the adventure background as
well as Marten’s and Alban’s personal backgrounds. At the GM’s
discretion, the journal could also contain valuable secrets such as
details of Empirical shipping schedules that can be exploited by the
PCs.

# Senior Officers’ Quarters
Each of these private quarters can be
locked with a simple lock (AC 14, 10 hp, immune to poison &amp; psychic
damage) and has a bunk and a desk for storing personal effects. A
character using thieves&#39; tools can try to pick a lock, which requires 2
turns and a successful DC 18 *Dexterity* check.

*Ransack:* Searching all three officer’s quarters only counts as
searching one area. In the quartermaster’s cabin (**8a**) there is a
hidden cache of pearls worth a +3 bonus to the Ransacking check, which
can be found with a DC 24 *Wisdom* (Perception) check.

# Quartermaster’s Cabin
This cabin has the small luxury of a
large porthole to let fresh air in. The quartermaster bunks here.

# Masters’ Quarters
This cabin has two beds and the master gunner
and sailing master bunk here.

# Boatswain’s Quarters
These quarters have a little extra room in
the form of a large closet. The Hand’s current cabin boy (secretly the
boatswain’s cousin) has set up a sleep pallet in the closet.

# Captain’s Lounge
This sumptuous room is where the captain has
dinner parties with guests, holds meetings with his senior officers, and
performs much of the paperwork that comes with being an imperial ship’s
captain. A polished hardwood table dominates the center of the room and
a cupboard holds fine porcelain dishes and silverware. A long closet
stores a cluttered collection of trade ledgers, maps, paperwork, and a
number of bottles of imperial brandy.

*Ransack:* Among the clutter in the closet there are many nautical
charts, but a DC 20 *Wisdom* (Perception) check followed by a DC 16 *Wisdom*
(Survival) check recognizes part of a detailed but unlabeled old and
worn map as part of the coastline of the southern continent. Marked on
it are several small islands and even a city unknown to modern sailors.
Notes on the map claim it is a copy of a copy but even still, it can be
sold for a substantial price giving the PCs a +3 bonus on the Ransacking
check.

# Captain’s Cabin
This large luxuriously appointed cabin has a
large double bed in the corner and four large glass windows offer views
astern of the ship. A polished marble table sits in the middle of the
room and a small door to one side reveals a sizable wardrobe of
clothing.

*Ransack:* While most of the wealth here is openly on display, a DC 15
*Intelligence* (History) check notices a small bronze plaque with the
imperial seal. Only the hand of the Emperor himself can give this mark
of distinction and even a stolen one is worth a significant amount: add
a +1 bonus to the Ransacking check.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Battle Deck Map" tags="lugares @battle-deck-map" position="1362,453" size="100,100">
# Battle Deck
There are 26 ballistae here, 11 each side running
the length of the ship for its powerful broadsides and pairs of
ballistae facing both forward and aft as chasers. In between the masts
are large trunks that hold reserves of ballista bolts and other ship’s
munitions.

# Whipstaff Steerage Assembly
Behind paneled partitions is a series of chains, fulcrums, and other apparatus designed to transfer the force from turn of the ship’s wheel to the Hand’s massive tiller.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Berth Deck Map" tags="lugares @berth-deck-map" position="1493,453" size="100,100">
# Gunners’ Quarters
Lines of hammocks hang between support poles
crowding this large crew quarters. The ship’s gunners rest and sleep
here.

# Main Crew Quarters
The two cargo hatches take up the center of
this area leaving only limited room for hammocks around the edges. Piles
of sleeping pallets are stacked to either side of the stairs at the aft
of the room.

# Galley
A long bench between the two doorways on the port side
of this cooking area allows for fast service of food to the large crew.

# Quartermaster’s Workroom
This workshop contains benches and
shelves holding wood and metalworking tools used to repair the ship.

# Ships Stores
This room contains spare seafaring equipment and
raw materials to repair or manufacture replacements for lost or broken
ship’s gear.

# Larder
Fruit, fresh food, water, and other perishables are
stored here.

# Food Stores
Barrels and sealed containers hold salted meat and
other preserved foodstuffs here.

*Ransack:* A DC 25 *Intelligence* (Investigation) check finds a stash of narcotics hidden in the bottom of a small cask of dried peppers. This adds a +4 bonus to the Ransacking check.

# Grog Storage
This small space in the innards of the ship holds
supplies of wine, rum, and other drink. The door is locked (AC 16 14 hp,
immune to poison &amp; psychic damage) but several of the ship’s officers
have the key. A character using thieves&#39; tools can try to pick a lock,
which requires 3 turns and a successful DC 20 *Dexterity* check.

*Ransack:* Anyone proficient with the brewer’s supplies or a DC 15
*Intelligence* check reveals bottles of potent and valuable liquor in one
corner worth +2 to the Ransacking check.

# Armory
Rows of well-oiled weapons and trunks of armament for
the crew fill this curved room.

*Ransack:* A DC 16 *Wisdom* (Perception) check or a character proficient
with smith’s tools turns up a stockpile of excellent weapons at the back
of a weapon’s locker. This adds +2 to the PCs’ ransacking check.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Orlop Deck Map" tags="lugares @orlop-deck-map" position="1625,454" size="100,100">
# Petty Officers’ Quarters
These quarters offer some privacy and
slightly more room for the ship’s junior officers. The hammocks are more
comfortable and have more room between them.

&gt;* If you are scaling the adventure up, include this character in this area:
&gt;* *Galtus Ossian*

# Surgeon and Carpenter’s Quarters
* 2 Clerics (use *commoner* stats)  

This cramped area holds bunks
and sleeping pallets for the Hand’s surgeon, healers, and master
carpenter. The two ship’s healers are non-combatant clerics (stats as a
Commoner but with a *Wisdom* of 15) but can use their spells and
channeling to heal some of the captain’s or crew’s wounds if they
retreat here.

***Spellcasting***. The clerics are 3rd-level spellcasters. They’re
spellcasting ability is *Wisdom* (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell
attacks). The clerics have the following spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): *light*, *mending*, *resistance*

1st level (4 slots): *cure wounds*, *healing word*, *inflict wounds*

2nd level (2 slots): *hold person*, *silence*  

&gt;* If you are scaling the adventure up, replace the two healers in
area 22 with these two clerics.
&gt;* *Imperial Priests*

# Infirmary
Two cots and a table for treating patients furnish
this room as well as a large cabinet of medical supplies.

*Ransack:* A successful DC 20 *Wisdom* (Medicine) check identifies
valuable healing herbs and medicines as well as sets of excellently made
medical tools. This adds a +1 bonus to the Ransacking check. Also, a DC
25 *Wisdom* (Perception) check or detecting magic in this area reveals a
hidden reserve of healing potions and alchemical antidotes worth a +2
bonus to the Ransacking check.

# Cargo Storage
Bulkheads partition this large area giving the
ship extra structural support and providing additional means of securing
cargo to prevent slippage in rough seas. The area currently holds hides
and furs from the tropical south, a huge shipment of fibrous jute, and a
large quantity of grain. Buried in among these bulk goods are more
valuable commodities, including several crates of ivory, reams of fine
cloth, well-sealed containers of salt, and cases of tobacco.

*Ransack:* PCs can make four DC 18 *Wisdom* (Perception) checks to find
the valuable commodities, with each successful check adding a +1 bonus
to the Ransacking check (maximum of a +4 bonus). A DC 20 *Wisdom*
(Survival) check also finds a selection of high-quality furs in the
midst of some unexceptional hides giving a +3 bonus to the Ransacking
check.

# Private Storeroom
The cargo doors to this area are locked (AC
15, 20 hp, immune to poison &amp; psychic damage). A character using
thieves&#39; tools can try to pick a lock, which requires 4 turns and a
successful DC 25 *Dexterity* check. The only key is in the captain’s
cabin. This storeroom is used to transport important merchandise
directly for the crown or for highly confidential cargoes, but is
currently empty.

*Ransack:* If the PCs spend more than 1–1/2 minutes breaking into this
area, then this counts toward the number of areas they can search.
Otherwise, they search this area for free, but find nothing that helps
with the Ransacking check.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Hold Map" tags="lugares @hold-map" position="1757,456" size="100,100">
# Brig/Secure Compartments
These two small compartments in the
bowels of the ship have reinforced doors set with heavy bars and solid
locks leading into each of them. A small metal grille set in each door
allows observation from the outside. Both doors are currently unlocked.
Designed to hold prisoners or punish sailors, the compartments can also
serve as secure storage areas. Both compartments have piles of rough
bedding and the starboard one holds an impressive amount of broken
furnishings, discarded empty boxes, and other junk.

*Ransack:* A DC 20 *Wisdom* (Perception) check turns up a heavy chest
buried under the junk in the starboard compartment. This is the Hand’s
pay chest concealed here by one of the senior officers while the PCs’
ship approached. It is worth a +6 bonus to the Ransacking check.

# Main Hold
This area is reserved for ballast and the heaviest
cargo which helps keep the ship stable in even the worst storms. Even
when not carrying cargo, the sheer size of the ship makes it very
difficult to capsize. The forward storage area holds spare ship’s
supplies and basic materials used to maintain the hand. The cargo here
consists of iron and copper ingots, lumber, stone bricks, and barrels of
tar and pitch.

*Ransack:* A DC 16 *Intelligence* (Nature) check can identify the rarer woods adding a +2 bonus to the Ransacking check and a character
proficient with alchemist’s supplies reveals high quality oils worth a
+3 bonus to the Ransacking check.

# Bilges

Since the *King&#39;s Hand* is still a new ship, the bilges are not yet as
unpleasant as other ships. Having been properly built and sealed, there
is very little leakage and the size of the ship means there is usually
only a couple of inches of water. In the center of the bilges is a large
pump next to stairs leading up to the cargo hold.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
