<p><b>Friend Shield:</b> These curious rings always come in pairs. A <i>friend shield </i>ring without its mate is useless. Either wearer of one of a pair of the rings can, at any time, command his or her ring to cast a <i><a href="SRD_Shield_Other.html" title="SRD:Shield Other">shield other</a> </i>spell with the wearer of the mated ring as the recipient. This effect has no range limitation.
