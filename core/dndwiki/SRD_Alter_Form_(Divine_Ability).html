<p>This is an <a href="SRD_Extraordinary_Ability.html" title="SRD:Extraordinary Ability" class="mw-redirect">extraordinary ability</a>.
</p><p><b>Prerequisite:</b> <a href="SRD_Alter_Size_(Divine_Ability).html" title="SRD:Alter Size (Divine Ability)">Alter Size</a> salient divine ability.
</p><p><b>Benefit:</b> As a move-equivalent action, the deity can alter its form, including clothing and equipment. The assumed form must be corporeal. The deity’s body can undergo a limited physical transmutation, including adding or subtracting one or two limbs. If the form selected has wings, the deity can fly. Likewise, the deity can swim if the form has fins, breathe water if the form has gills, and so on.
</p><p>The deity can remain in the altered form indefinitely, but resumes its own form if slain.
</p><p><b>Notes:</b> The deity’s attack bonus, <a href="SRD_Armor_Class.html" title="SRD:Armor Class">Armor Class</a>, and saves do not change. The deity does not gain any of the assumed form’s special abilities, attack forms, defenses, ability scores, or mannerisms. The deity can change physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, skin color, and gender). The deity can use this ability to create disguises, gaining a bonus of +10 on its <a href="SRD_Disguise_Skill.html" title="SRD:Disguise Skill">Disguise</a> checks. The deity can use its <a href="SRD_Alter_Size_(Divine_Ability).html" title="SRD:Alter Size (Divine Ability)">Alter Size</a> ability simultaneously along with this one to become taller, shorter, thinner, or heavier.
