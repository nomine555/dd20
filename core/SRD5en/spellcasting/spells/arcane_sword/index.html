<p><em>7th-level evocation</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp) <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute </p>
<p>You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.  <br/>
When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one. </p></div>
