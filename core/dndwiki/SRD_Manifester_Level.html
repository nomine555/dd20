<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Manifesting_Powers">Manifesting <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">Powers</a></span></h2>
<p>Psionic characters and creatures manifest <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>. Whether they cost <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> when manifest by a psionic character, or are manifested as <a href="SRD_Psi-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Psi-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">psi-like abilities</a>, <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>’ effects remain the same. The process of manifesting a power is akin to casting a spell, but with significant differences.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Choosing_a_Power">Choosing a Power</span></h3>
<p>First you must choose which power to manifest. You can select any power you know, provided you are capable of manifesting <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> of that level or higher. To manifest a power, you must pay <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a>, which count against your daily total. You can manifest the same power multiple times if you have points left to pay for it.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Concentration"><a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a></span></h3>
<p>To manifest a power, you must concentrate. If something threatens to interrupt your concentration while you’re manifesting a power, you must succeed on a <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> check or lose the <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> without manifesting the power. The more distracting the interruption and the higher the level of the power that you are trying to manifest, the higher the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a>. (Higher-level <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> require more mental effort.)
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Injury">Injury</span></h5>
<p>Getting hurt or being affected by hostile psionics while trying to manifest a power can break your concentration and ruin a power. If you take damage while trying to manifest a power, you must make a <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> check (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 10 + points of damage taken + the level of the power you’re manifesting). The interrupting event strikes during manifestation if it occurs between when you start and when you complete manifesting a power (for a power with a manifesting time of 1 <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> or longer) or if it comes in response to your manifesting the power (such as an <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attack of opportunity</a> provoked by the manifesting of the power or a contingent attack from a readied action).
</p><p>If you are taking continuous damage half the damage is considered to take place while you are manifesting a power. You must make a <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> check (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 10 + 1/2 the damage that the continuous source last dealt + the level of the power you’re manifesting).
</p><p>If the last damage dealt was the last damage that the effect could deal then the damage is over, and it does not distract you.
</p><p>Repeated damage does not count as continuous damage.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Power">Power</span></h5>
<p>If you are affected by a power while attempting to manifest a power of your own, you must make a <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> check or lose the power you are manifesting. If the power affecting you deals damage, the <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> is 10 + points of damage + the level of the power you’re manifesting. If the power interferes with you or distracts you in some other way, the <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> is the power’s save <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> + the level of the power you’re manifesting. For a power with no <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a>, it’s the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> that the power’s <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throw</a> would have if a save were allowed.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Grappling_or_Pinned">Grappling or Pinned</span></h5>
<p>To manifest a power while <a href="SRD_Grappling.html" title="SRD:Grappling">grappling</a> or <a href="SRD_Pinned.html" title="SRD:Pinned">pinned</a>, you must make a <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> check (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 20 + the level of the power you’re manifesting) or lose the power.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Vigorous_Motion">Vigorous Motion</span></h5>
<p>If you are riding on a moving mount, taking a bouncy ride in a wagon, on a small boat in rough water, belowdecks in a storm-tossed ship, or simply being jostled in a similar fashion, you must make a <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> check (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 10 + the level of the power you’re manifesting) or lose the power.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Violent_Motion">Violent Motion</span></h5>
<p>If you are on a galloping horse, taking a very rough ride in a wagon, on a small boat in rapids or in a storm, on deck in a storm-tossed ship, or being tossed roughly about in a similar fashion, you must make a <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> check (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 + the level of the power you’re manifesting) or lose the power.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Violent_Weather">Violent Weather</span></h5>
<p>If you are in a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet, the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> is 5 + the level of the power you’re manifesting. If you are in wind-driven hail, dust, or debris, the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> is 10 + the level of the power you’re manifesting. In either case, you lose the power if you fail the <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> check. If the weather is caused by a power, use the rules in the Power subsection above.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Manifesting_Powers_on_the_Defensive">Manifesting <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">Powers</a> on the Defensive</span></h5>
<p>If you want to manifest a power without provoking <a href="SRD_Attack_of_Opportunity.html" title="SRD:Attack of Opportunity" class="mw-redirect">attacks of opportunity</a>, you need to dodge and weave. You must make a <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> check (<a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 + the level of the power you’re manifesting) to succeed. You lose the <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> without successful manifestation if you fail.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Entangled">Entangled</span></h5>
<p>If you want to manifest a power while <a href="SRD_Entangled.html" title="SRD:Entangled">entangled</a> in a net or while affected by a power with similar effects you must make a <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> 15 <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a> check to manifest the power. You lose the power if you fail.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Manifester_Level">Manifester Level</span></h3>
<p>The variables of a power’s effect often depend on its <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>, which is equal to your psionic <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> level. A power that can be augmented for additional effect is also limited by your <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a> (you can’t spend more <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> on a power than your <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>). See Augment under Descriptive Text, below.
</p><p>You can manifest a power at a lower <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a> than normal, but the <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a> must be high enough for you to manifest the power in question, and all level-dependent features must be based on the same <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>.
</p><p>In the event that a <a href="SRD_Class.html" title="SRD:Class" class="mw-redirect">class</a> feature or other special ability provides an adjustment to your <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a>, this adjustment applies not only to all effects based on <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a> (such as range, duration, and augmentation potential) but also to your <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a> check to overcome your target’s power resistance and to the <a href="SRD_Manifester_Level.html" title="SRD:Manifester Level" class="mw-redirect">manifester level</a> used in dispel checks (both the dispel check and the <a href="SRD_DC.html" title="SRD:DC" class="mw-redirect">DC</a> of the check).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Power_Failure">Power Failure</span></h3>
<p>If you try to manifest a power in conditions where the characteristics of the power (range, area, and so on) cannot be made to conform, the manifestation fails and the <a href="SRD_Power_Points.html" title="SRD:Power Points" class="mw-redirect">power points</a> are wasted. 
</p><p><a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">Powers</a> also fail if your concentration is broken (see <a href="SRD_Concentration_Skill.html" title="SRD:Concentration Skill">Concentration</a>, above).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Power.E2.80.99s_Result">The Power’s Result</span></h3>
<p>Once you know which creatures (or objects or areas) are affected, and whether those creatures have made successful <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throws</a> (if any were allowed), you can apply whatever results a power entails.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Special_Power_Effects">Special Power Effects</span></h3>
<p>Certain special features apply to all <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Attacks">Attacks</span></h5>
<p>Some <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> refer to attacking. All offensive combat actions, even those that don’t damage opponents, such as <a href="SRD_Disarm.html" title="SRD:Disarm">disarm</a> and bull rush, are considered attacks. All <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> that opponents can resist with <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throws</a>, that deal damage, or that otherwise harm or hamper subjects are considered attacks. <i>Astral <a href="SRD_Construct_Type.html" title="SRD:Construct Type">construct</a> </i>and similar <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> are not considered attacks because the <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> themselves don’t harm anyone.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Bonus_Types">Bonus Types</span></h5>
<p>Many <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> give creatures bonuses to ability scores, <a href="SRD_Armor_Class.html" title="SRD:Armor Class">Armor Class</a>, attacks, and other attributes. Each bonus has a type that indicates how the power grants the bonus. The important aspect of bonus types is that two bonuses of the same type don’t generally stack. With the exception of dodge bonuses, most circumstance bonuses, and racial bonuses, only the better bonus works (see Combining Psionic and Magical Effects, below). The same principle applies to penalties—a character taking two or more penalties of the same type applies only the worst one.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Bringing_Back_the_Dead">Bringing Back the Dead</span></h5>
<p><s>Of all the psionic <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, only <i>reality revision</i> has the ability to restore slain characters to life. </s><span class="errata">Various psionic <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, such as <i><a href="SRD_Reality_Revision.html" title="SRD:Reality Revision">reality revision</a></i> and <i><a href="SRD_Psionic_Revivify.html" title="SRD:Psionic Revivify">psionic revivify</a></i>, have the ability to restore slain characters to life.</span> When a living creature dies, its soul departs the body, leaves the <a href="SRD_Material_Plane.html" title="SRD:Material Plane">Material Plane</a>, travels through the <a href="SRD_Astral_Plane.html" title="SRD:Astral Plane">Astral Plane</a>, and goes to abide on the plane where the creature’s deity resides. If the creature did not worship a deity, its soul departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment. Bringing someone back from the <a href="SRD_Dead.html" title="SRD:Dead">dead</a> means retrieving his or her soul and returning it to his or her body.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Level_Loss">Level Loss</span></h6>
<p>The passage from life to death and back again is a wrenching journey for a being’s soul. Consequently, any creature brought back to life usually loses one level of experience. The character’s new experience point total is midway between the minimum needed for his or her new (reduced) level and the minimum needed for the next one. If the character was 1st level at the time of death, he or she loses 2 points of <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a> instead of losing a level. This level loss or <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a> loss cannot be repaired by any mortal means, even the spells <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i>. A revived character can regain a lost level by earning XP through further adventuring. A revived character who was 1st level at the time of death can regain lost points of <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a> by improving his or her <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a> score when he or she attains a level that allows an <a href="SRD_Ability_Scores.html" title="SRD:Ability Scores">ability score</a> increase.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Preventing_Revivification">Preventing Revivification</span></h6>
<p>Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be returned from the <a href="SRD_Dead.html" title="SRD:Dead">dead</a>. Keeping the body prevents others from using a single manifestation of <i>reality revision</i> to restore the slain character to life.
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Revivification_Against_One.E2.80.99s_Will">Revivification Against One’s <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Will</a></span></h6>
<p>A soul cannot be returned to life if it does not wish to be. A soul knows the name, alignment, and patron deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and may refuse to return on that basis.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Combining_Psionic_and_Magical_Effects">Combining Psionic and Magical Effects</span></h3>
<p>The default rule for the interaction of psionics and magic is simple: <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">Powers</a> interact with spells and spells interact with <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> in the same way a spell or normal <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like ability</a> interacts with another spell or <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like ability</a>. This is known as psionics–magic transparency.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Psionics.E2.80.93Magic_Transparency">Psionics–Magic Transparency</span></h5>
<p>Though not explicitly called out in the spell descriptions or magic item descriptions, spells, <a href="SRD_Spell-Like_Ability.html" title="SRD:Spell-Like Ability" class="mw-redirect">spell-like abilities</a>, and magic items that could potentially affect psionics do affect psionics. 
</p><p>When the rule about psionics–magic transparency is in effect, it has the following ramifications.
<a href="SRD_Spell_Resistance.html" title="SRD:Spell Resistance" class="mw-redirect">Spell resistance</a> is effective against <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, using the same mechanics. Likewise, power resistance is effective against spells, using the same mechanics as <a href="SRD_Spell_Resistance.html" title="SRD:Spell Resistance" class="mw-redirect">spell resistance</a>. If a creature has one kind of resistance, it is assumed to have the other. (The effects have similar ends despite having been brought about by different means.)
</p><p>All spells that <i>dispel magic</i> have equal effect against <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> of the same level using the same mechanics, and vice versa.
</p><p>The spell <i>detect magic</i> detects <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, their number, and their strength and location within 3 rounds (though a <a href="SRD_Psicraft_Skill.html" title="SRD:Psicraft Skill">Psicraft</a> check is necessary to identify the discipline of the psionic aura).
<a href="SRD_Dead.html" title="SRD:Dead">Dead</a> magic areas are also <a href="SRD_Dead.html" title="SRD:Dead">dead</a> psionics areas.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Multiple_Effects">Multiple Effects</span></h5>
<p><a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">Powers</a> or psionic effects usually work as described no matter how many other <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, psionic effects, spells, or magical effects happen to be operating in the same area or on the same recipient. Except in special cases, a power does not affect the way another power or spell operates. Whenever a power has a specific effect on other <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> or spells, the power description explains the effect (and vice versa for spells that affect <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>). Several other general rules apply when <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, spells, magical effects, or psionic effects operate in the same place.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Stacking_Effects">Stacking Effects</span></h5>
<p><a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">Powers</a> that provide bonuses or penalties on <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack rolls</a>, <a href="SRD_Attack_Damage.html" title="SRD:Attack Damage">damage rolls</a>, <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throws</a>, and other attributes usually do not stack with themselves. More generally, two bonuses of the same type don’t stack even if they come from different <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, or one from a power and one from a spell. You use whichever bonus gives you the better result. 
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Different_Bonus_Types">Different Bonus Types</span></h6>
<p>The bonuses or penalties from two different <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a>, or a power and a spell, stack if the effects are of different types. A bonus that isn’t named (just a “+2 bonus” rather than a “+2 insight bonus”) stacks with any bonus.

<p>In cases when two or more similar or identical effects are operating in the same area or on the same target, but at different strengths, only the best one applies. If one power or spell is dispelled or its duration runs out, the other power or spell remains in effect (assuming its duration has not yet expired).
</p>
<h6><span class="mw-headline" id="Same_Effect_with_Differing_Results">Same Effect with Differing Results</span></h6>
<p>The same power or spell can sometimes produce varying effects if applied to the same recipient more than once. The last effect in a series trumps the others. None of the previous spells or <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> are actually removed or dispelled, but their effects become irrelevant while the final spell or power in the series lasts.

<p>Sometimes, a power can render another power irrelevant.
Multiple Mental Control Effects: Sometimes psionic or magical effects that establish mental control render one another irrelevant. Mental controls that don’t remove the recipient’s ability to act usually do not interfere with one another, though one may modify another. If a creature is under the control of two or more creatures, it tends to obey each to the best of its ability, and to the extent of the control each effect allows. If the controlled creature receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing controllers must make opposed <a href="http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Charisma_Check" title="SRD:Charisma Check" class="mw-redirect">Charisma checks</a> to determine which one the creature obeys.

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Powers_and_Spells_with_Opposite_Effects">Powers and Spells with Opposite Effects</span></h5>
<p><a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">Powers</a> and spells with opposite effects apply normally, with all bonuses, penalties, or changes accruing in the order that they apply. Some <a href="SRD_Powers.html" title="SRD:Powers">powers</a> and spells negate or counter each other. This is a special effect that is noted in a power’s or spell’s description.

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Instantaneous_Effects">Instantaneous Effects</span></h5>
<p>Two or more magical or psionic effects with instantaneous durations work cumulatively when they affect the same object, place, or creature.
