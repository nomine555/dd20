<p>A creature with the fast healing special quality regains <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> at an exceptionally fast rate, usually 1 or more <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> per <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a>, as given in the creature’s entry. Except where noted here, fast healing is just like natural healing. At the beginning of each of the creature’s turns, it heals a certain number of <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> (defined in its description). A creature that has taken both nonlethal and lethal damage heals the <a href="SRD_Nonlethal_Damage.html" title="SRD:Nonlethal Damage">nonlethal damage</a> first. Fast healing does not restore <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does not allow a creature to regrow lost body parts. Unless otherwise stated, it does not allow lost body parts to be reattached. Fast healing does not increase the number of <a href="SRD_Hit_Points.html" title="SRD:Hit Points" class="mw-redirect">hit points</a> regained when a creature polymorphs.
