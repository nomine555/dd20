<p><b>Chime of Opening:</b> A <i>chime of opening </i>is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A <i>chime of opening </i>also automatically dispels a <i><a href="SRD_Hold_Portal.html" title="SRD:Hold Portal">hold portal</a> </i>spell or even an <i><a href="SRD_Arcane_Lock.html" title="SRD:Arcane Lock">arcane lock</a> </i>cast by a <a href="SRD_Wizard.html" title="SRD:Wizard">wizard</a> of lower than 15th level.
</p><p>The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck, a clear tone rings forth, and in 1 <a href="SRD_Round.html" title="SRD:Round" class="mw-redirect">round</a> the target lock is unlocked, the shackle is loosed, the secret door is opened, or the lid of the chest is lifted. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and <i><a href="SRD_Arcane_Lock.html" title="SRD:Arcane Lock">arcane locked</a>, </i>it takes four uses of a <i>chime of opening </i>to get it open. A <i><a href="SRD_Silence.html" title="SRD:Silence">silence</a> </i>spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of ten times before it cracks and becomes useless.
