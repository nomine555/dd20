<p>A frightened creature flees from the source of its fear as best it can. If unable to flee, it may fight. A frightened creature takes a â€“2 penalty on all <a href="SRD_Attack_Roll.html" title="SRD:Attack Roll">attack rolls</a>, <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">saving throws</a>, <a href="SRD_Skill_Check.html" title="SRD:Skill Check" class="mw-redirect">skill checks</a>, and <a href="SRD_Ability_Check.html" title="SRD:Ability Check" class="mw-redirect">ability checks</a>. A frightened creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape. 
</p><p>Frightened is like <a href="SRD_Shaken.html" title="SRD:Shaken">shaken</a>, except that the creature must flee if possible. <a href="SRD_Panicked.html" title="SRD:Panicked">Panicked</a> is a more extreme state of fear.
