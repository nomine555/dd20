<p><em>Potion, uncommon</em> </p>
<p>This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a <strong>potion of healing</strong> or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/identify/index.html">Identify</a></em></strong> spell reveals its true nature.  <br/>
If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/constitution/index.html">Constitution</a> saving throw or be <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Poisoned</a>. At the start of each of your turns while you are <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Poisoned</a> in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0. </p></div>
