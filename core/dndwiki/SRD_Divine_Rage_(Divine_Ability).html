<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Divine_Rage">Divine Rage</span></h2>
<p><b>Prerequisite:</b> <a href="SRD_Barbarian.html" title="SRD:Barbarian">Barbarian</a> level 20th.
</p><p><b>Benefit:</b> This ability is similar to the <a href="SRD_Barbarian.html" title="SRD:Barbarian">barbarian</a>’s rage ability (and it replaces the <a href="SRD_Barbarian.html" title="SRD:Barbarian">barbarian</a> rage ability for the deity). The deity can activate this ability only after suffering damage from a weapon, and can use it a number of times per day equal to its divine rank. Once used, the ability lasts 1 hour (though the deity can end the rage at will). While raging, the deity gains +10 to <a href="SRD_Strength.html" title="SRD:Strength">Strength</a>, +10 to <a href="SRD_Constitution.html" title="SRD:Constitution">Constitution</a>, and a +5 morale bonus on <a href="SRD_Saving_Throw.html" title="SRD:Saving Throw">Will</a> saves. The deity’s <a href="SRD_Spell_Resistance.html" title="SRD:Spell Resistance" class="mw-redirect">spell resistance</a> and energy resistances each increase by +10. The deity also can make one extra attack, at its full attack bonus, whenever it uses the full attack action. While raging, the deity suffers a –5 penalty to <a href="SRD_Armor_Class.html" title="SRD:Armor Class">Armor Class</a> and cannot perform acts that require patience and concentration, such as moving silently, casting spells, and using salient divine abilities.
