<strong>Slam.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.  <br/>
<strong>Slow (Recharge 5–6).</strong> The golem targets one or more creatures it can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 17 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p></div>
