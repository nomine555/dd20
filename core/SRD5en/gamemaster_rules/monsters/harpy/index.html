<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> The harpy makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its club.  <br/>
<strong>Claws.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage.  <br/>
<strong>Club.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage.  <br/>
<strong>Luring Song.</strong> The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> saving throw or be <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a> until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Incapacitated</a>.  <br/>
While <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a> by the harpy, a target is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Incapacitated</a> and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a> target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Charmed</a> target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.  <br/>
A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song for the next 24 hours.</p></div>
