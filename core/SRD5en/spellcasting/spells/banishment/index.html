<div class="col-md-9" role="main"><h1 id="banishment">Banishment</h1>
<p><em>4th-level abjuration</em> </p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action <br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet <br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (an item distasteful to the target) <br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute </p>
<p>You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/charisma/index.html">Charisma</a> saving throw or be banished.  <br/>
If the target is native to the plane of existence you're on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Incapacitated</a>. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.  <br/>
If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you're on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn't return. </p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. </p></div>
