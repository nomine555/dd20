<h1 id="summary">SUMMARY</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A powerful necromancer, Gramdum Elojia, tried to use an artefact to absorb the divine energy of the body of a long-dead ancient god floating on the Astral Plane. During the process, an enormous magical explosion scattered the remains over the First Material Plane. Gramdum Elojia has located some of these remains, and has sent expeditions to retrieve the rest. The first of these expeditions is on the Invader’s Mountains and is working on finding the remains of the head of the deceased god, Rakaj.</p>
<p>Because of the brutal impact of his head against the mountain range, a thick cloud of floating ash and dirt spread over the entire region, razing crops to the ground and killing the cattle of nearby farms. Although the area is sparsely populated, its residents have been forced to abandon their homes and take shelter in the neighboring city of Sâlorium. The necromancer knows that the city’s authorities will soon send someone to find out what has happened, and he is not prepared for his secret to be revealed yet. For this reason, he decides to launch a brutal attack on Sâlorium in order to deplete its defenses and buy enough time to finish his job on the Invader’s Mountains.</p>
<p>To do this, Gramdum Elojia sends Doris - his trusty shapeshifter - to replace Professor Glaucom, a teacher at the School of Magic. Doris must also open a series of portals through which to send a mob to destroy the School, the city’s main line of defense. And so, players find themselves in the middle of a rapid mortal attack on Sâlorium’s citizens’ only hope of surviving Gramdum Elojia’s evil plans.</p>
<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
<p>Rakaj died millennia ago. During one of the battles between Gods and Primordials, the ancient deity met his maker, and - like many others back then - was soon forgotten. After his death, his body was left floating in the ether of the Astral Plane, where it has drifted for eons. There is a theory that these petrified titans are not really dead, but merely in a state of semi-rest. Many witnesses report that the memories of the deceased gods are reflected as strange dreams in the minds of those who dare to set foot upon the surface of these sleeping giants. One of the scholars upholding this theory is Gramdum Elojia, a powerful necromancer belonging to a small cult devoted to the Mother of Demons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cult’s name is only ever whispered throughout the Multiverse. Hushed voices, murmuring like ancient texts, claim that the Mother of Demons gave birth to the lords that govern the Abyss. Other sources go further, daring to claim that the entire demon race is descended from her. But these are only rumors, that are silenced in turn when some brainless person is foolish enough to try to solve the mystery surrounding the so-called Mother of Demons. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For centuries, Gramdum Elojia has devoted all of his time and resources to investigating the possibility that some traces of power are still pulsing inside these formidable divine remains, known among the inhabitants of the Astral Plane as God-Islands.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A God-Island is the petrified corpse of a deity whose surface has been altered by unpleasant astral races who have made it their home, building floating cities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gramdum Elojia has tirelessly searched for an uncolonized cadaver, and it was not until just a few months ago that he found the lifeless body of Rakaj floating in the Astral Sea. Thanks to an artefact known as the Assimilator, he managed to extract some of the divine power that still existed inside the dead god. But before he was able to absorb all of this energy, the artefact collapsed, created a vortex that obliterated the rest of the body and scattered it over the First Material Plane. The pieces of Rakaj were littered in varying sizes, from small pulsing shards of power to vast pieces the size of mountains. After overcoming his failure and licking his wounds, Gramdum Elojia located some of these fragments and organized an expedition to finish the job. His first destination, the Invader’s Mountains, is a sparsely populated area a few hundred leagues from the City of Sâlorium, home of the Character Players.</p>
<h2 id="adventure-synopsis">Adventure Synopsis</h2>
<p>In this adventure, players will see their home attacked by Gramdum Elojia’s army, and will discover the mysteries that have brought these beings to their home.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ACT I - <strong>Attack on the School</strong>: While Gramdum Elojia’s expedition is looking for the head of deceased god Rakaj on the Invader’s Mountains, the necromancer orders an attack on the neighboring city of Sâlorium. Players are immersed in a brutal attack carried out by a demonic army which descends on the city’s School of Magic via portals. They must protect their own lives and those of other citizens.</p>
</li>
<li><p>ACT II - <strong>Searching for the culprits</strong>: After the attack, survivors seek refuge in the Temple’s crypt, fearful of a second assault. Players must find out who the traitor is who opened the portals and allowed the demons to wreak havoc in the School of Magic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>ACT III - <strong>Finding Doris</strong>: Characters go outside in search of Doris, the shapeshifter sent by Gramdum Elojia to replace Professor Glaucom.</p>
</li>
<li><p>ACT IV - <strong>Finding Bones</strong>: To be able to interrogate Doris, players must first help Miss Bilwa, who sends them on a journey to Sâlorium Cemetery in search of some strange ingredients for a potion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>CONCLUSION - With the help of an Elixir of Truth, players finally find out the origin of the attack on the School. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Players must complete the following seven tasks at the least in order to complete the Adventure.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>After investigating in the School of Magic, players are clear that someone opened the portals inside the Academy. Players end up <strong>searching for the professor of portals, Glaucom</strong>, only to discover that he has committed suicide. A more in-depth investigation reveals that he was actually murdered days ago, but witnesses claim to have seen him only minutes ago. Players will also discover that for the past few weeks, Professor Glaucom has been visiting a tavern known as <strong>The White Whale</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Players arrive at <strong>The White Whale</strong>, dodging the demons still wandering the city’s alleys. Inside, they find Professor Glaucom, who reveals his true appearance: a shapeshifter called Doris. They enter combat and the players capture the impostor.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Doris refuses to give any information and will only do so after ingesting an <strong>Elixir of Truth</strong>. For this, players must ask Miss Bilwa to prepare the potion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Players <strong>locate Miss Bilwa destroying the laboratory of Professor Nizgul</strong>. Miss Bilwa confesses that she is actually nearly 100 years old and has stayed young with the help of eternal life potions, and that it was Professor Nizgul who provided her with the strange ingredients necessary to make the potions. Bilwa also confesses that the old necromancer was blackmailing her in return for the ingredients, and that he has not been giving her what she needed for the past year, so the magical effects of the potion have been wearing off. With Nizgul’s death, Miss Bilwa does not have much time before the effects disappear completely and she turns to dust, so she needs the players to find the materials before it is too late and she dies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Players go <strong>to the City Cemetery</strong>, where they must exhume a body in order to obtain one of the essential ingredients that Bilwa needs to create the Youth Potion that keeps her alive. There, they face the Guardian of the Dead, a spirit that watches over the deceased and keeps them from being disturbed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Having obtained the <strong>ingredient for the Youth Potion</strong>, Miss Bilwa hands over the Elixir of Truth for Doris. Doris finally reveals that her master sent her to open the portals to keep his work leagues outside of the city a secret. Doris does not know exactly what her master is doing and can only indicate where he is.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Players head to <strong>the Invader’s Mountains</strong>, where they find the head of the dead god, Rakaj.</p>
</li>

<h1 id="situation">SITUATION</h1>
<p>The adventure unfolds in Sâlorium, the main city in this part of the continent. Its well-placed bay and location as the last frontier of civilization against the savage north make it the financial and political epicenter of the region.</p>
<p>Over the last week, the city has been rocked by the arrival of hundreds of refugees from nearby areas. They have left their homes due to a gigantic cloud of ash and dirt that destroyed their crops and livestock. The authorities of the city have placed the refugees in a provisional camp on the grounds of the School of Magic while they decide how to deal with the situation. The truth is that no one in the city knows why the cloud formed, and paranoia among residents is growing by the day.</p>
<p>Read the following to the players so that they can place themselves in the current situation faced by Sâlorium:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peaceful daily life in Sâlorium has been interrupted over the last few days by the arrival of hundreds of refugees seeking safety within its walls and the protection of the famous and powerful residents of its School of Magic. The newcomers are farmers from neighboring areas, fleeing a gigantic cloud of dust and ash that has ruined their crops and killed their livestock. The authorities have placed the refugees on the School of Magic premises while they decide how to deal with the situation.
Nervousness and fear sweep the streets of a city that does not understand what is happening. Rumors abound in the taverns and markets. There is talk of a huge dragon that will soon come to Sâlorium to finish it and its inhabitants. Others claim that it is without a doubt some kind of spell cast by a shaman from the northern tribes as a warning of an imminent invasion by the savages. Some even see in the ash cloud signs that the world is coming to an end and that the punishment of the gods will soon be upon them. The good people of Sâlorium are overcome by their worst fears and they no longer leave their houses after nightfall. They have become more reserved and they watch the skies, waiting for some terrible evil to end their lives at any moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, it is time to read to each player where they are at the moment the adventure begins.</p>
<p>Each of the adventure’s pre-generated characters has a personal hook that situates them in a concrete time and circumstance before the action begins.</p>
<p>Read to each player the text of their hook and then go to <a href="encounter.html?param=18">Attack on the School</a>, or go straight there if you are not using the hooks. </p>
<h1 id="yonse-mage-">Yonse (Mage)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>You are the last student at Sâlorium’s School of Magic to go to bed tonight. You have spent the past 12 hours poring over the old books that Professor Roniam recommended to you, and you head to your room sleepy and hungry. You calculate that you can still get a few hours’ sleep before sunrise. With a yawn, you open the door to your room, blow out the lamp that lit your way here from the library, and sprawl onto your bed. You fall asleep straight away. Just a few minutes later, you are awoken by a loud crash. You think it came from the library, and it sounds as if several of the enormous bookshelves have just collapsed and been smashed to pieces.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="erundur-priest-">Erundur (Priest)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been a long but easy day. You barely had to tend to any of the refugees sheltering at the School of Magic. Just a few sprained ankles and patching up the head of a doleful halfling working as a prisoner building the camp. After dinner with some other clerics who have come to the School of Magic to help the needy, you sit down and take an old book from your backpack: “Poems from the Sea of Mirrors”.
After you have read for some hours, the camp is silent. Suddenly, a flash of light begins to draw on the floor a circle of incandescent light surrounded by arcane symbols. A vortex forms over it. The air begins to whirl round frantically, whipping up tents, barrels, and various tools that are lying nearby.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="raghar">Raghar</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Night falls and the Leader of the Guard, an old ex-soldier called Menzal, orders the guards of the School to tie up you prisoners for the night before going back to work tomorrow morning. You are shoved roughly against a post in the courtyard. After eating the disgusting soup they have the nerve to call food, you lie back on your pile of hay and try to sleep. After a few short hours of rest, a cry awakes you. Other screams quickly join in, and you hear people running.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="mr-pirs">Mr. Pirs</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>After another triumphant day in life, Mr. Pirs and his comrades are going to rest and celebrate a good day’s work. Relations did become somewhat strained between Mr. Pirs and the Leader of the Guard, Sergeant Menzal, when Mr. Pirs decided to slip away from the school’s Courtyard hidden among some barrels of fish in brine. But the difference in opinion between the two gentlemen was resolved honorably, and a three-centimeter gash in Mr. Pirs’ crown was fortunately patched up by a good elf priest. After sampling the meager meal brought by the servants, Mr. Pirs retires to his bedroom and lies on the hard, cold and sandy ground - just how he likes it. He has always maintained that it is unhealthy to sleep on mattresses or soft and comfortable surfaces, as they muddle the body and the quick mind the gods blessed him with. After some hours of tossing and turning on the floor trying to find an acceptable posture for rest, Mr. Pirs hears a scream. It seems that tonight, someone will be needing the amazing skills of Mr. Pirs.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="wilbur-thief-">Wilbur (Thief)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The chilly night has you rubbing your hands together to warm them up, even though you are wearing gloves. The wind is even colder on the rooftop where you are watching your target, crouched behind a chimney whose dark shadow masks your presence. You finish checking your equipment, adjust your straps and check the tension of the rope you have thrown to the other side of the street, to one of the School of Magic’s towers. You feel your harness tensing and your body wobbles as you swing into the void. Slowly and silently, you allow the pulleys and gravity to do their job, sliding you across the distance between the two buildings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allow the player to do something related to their class abilities - for example, Balance or Acrobatics - when they are sliding along the rope, and Open Locks when they want to force the skylight to get inside the School of Magic. They can also try Moving in Silence and/or Hiding in the Shadows. Bear in mind that these plays are so that the player feels like part of the story, but they should not be impossible to do, as it would not work for situating them in the next scene where they will meet some of their potential teammates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stealthily, you manage to open the skylight of the School of Magic’s Observatory, and with an agility born of years of training, you descend into the building by scaling down a long rope. You land on the ground and gracefully dart behind a table. Everything is dark and quiet. Just as you had calculated, you are inside the School Library. You stop there for a moment to catch your breath and are thinking about the chamber’s loot that will soon be in your hands when you hear the door open. You peek out from your hiding place and see one of the guards on their nightly rounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="monak-warrior-">Monak (Warrior)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>You are glad that tonight is your shift as a guard in the School of Magic. The cold outside makes keeping watch a real chore, and although pacing the dark corridors of the complex is not an enjoyable job, it is far more pleasant than spending hours in a stone lookout shivering and praying that none of your toes are frostbitten. After crossing the corridors with Professor Glaucom, one of the teachers at the school, you reluctantly open the door to the library to continue your rounds. You go inside and extend your arm, holding a lamp that barely illuminates the huge chamber. You weave laboriously between the enormous bookcases creaking under the weight of books and scrolls. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that Monak and Wilbur are in the same room, ask both players if they can do anything special. If not, read the following text for both of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a flash of light in the middle of the Library, and it begins to draw on the floor a circle of incandescent light surrounded by arcane symbols, and a whirlwind forms over it. The air begins to spin frenetically, whipping up scrolls, small books, and dust. The wind is gathering force and it knocks over two of the huge bookcases, which crash loudly to the floor and smash into pieces.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="welcome-adventurer-">Welcome, Adventurer,</h1>
<p>You have in your hands the first <strong>Tabletop RPG</strong> Adventure designed to be mastered from a tablet.
<em>The Siege of Sâlorium</em> is a medieval-fantasy adventure for Level 1 characters, and is launching DigitalD20’s first campaign. The adventure uses <em>D20 System</em> (compatible with <em>DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS®</em> and <em>Pathfinder®</em>) and can be adapted to any game world (<em>Forgotten Realms®</em>, <em>Dragonlance®</em>, <em>Golarion</em>...) </p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-roleplaying-game-">What is a roleplaying game?</h2>
<p>Roleplaying games consist of taking on roles, usually in fantasy worlds. You have to imagine how your adventurer would face the challenges presented by the game’s director. You play sitting around a table with your friends, with a few dice and ready to have a good time.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-play-siege-of-s-lorium-">What do I need to play <em>Siege of Sâlorium</em>?</h2>
<p>To play this adventure, you need to be familiarized with the <em>D20 gaming system</em> and have dice and a pencil and paper. <strong>The adventure itself gives you the necessary rules to resolve each encounter</strong>. You will also need character sheets. You can use your own or download the pre-generated sheets from the website www.digitald20.com. </p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-this-adventure">How to use this Adventure</h2>
<p>To play <em>Siege of Sâlorium</em> you can use the <a href="./ (./index.html?param=@personajes">pregenerated characters</a> or you can create your own characters.
The story works better if you use the pregenerated character hooks, as they are easily adaptable if you decide to use your own characters.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that the hooks provided situate each Character in a different situation before the start of the Adventure, and they encourage the players to work together to take on the challenges they will face.</p>
<p>You can read a <a href="./index.html?param=@resumen">synopsis of the adventure</a> or go directly to <a href="encounter.html?param=2">Start the Adventure</a> .</p>
<h2 id="how-does-gamethrough-work-">How does GameThrough work?</h2>
<p><em>GameThrough</em> divides the adventure’s content into encounters and scenes. The difference between encounters and scenes is only from the point of view of the story. In the encounters, a concrete situation is resolved - for example, a battle or an investigation - while the scenes describe more open-ended situations, such as exploring a city. Encounters and scenes are linked depending on players’ decisions. In the bottom left you will always find the <em>GameThrough</em> menu.<br>
<img src="../core/images/summary/gamethrough.jpg" class="icons-center"></p>
<h3 id="encounters-and-scenes">Encounters and Scenes</h3>

<h2 id="about-us">ABOUT US</h2>
<p>DigitalD20 is an App that is the brainchild of a group of roleplayers. While we were using tablets during games, we began to wonder if we could harness books in digital form. It has taken us over two years, but this is the final result.</p>

<h1 id="situation">SITUATION</h1>
<p>When things have calmed down after the first attack on the School, if players are sheltering in the Temple (2), read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You hear the last wave of pounding on the barricades you put across the Temple doors, followed by a heavy silence broken only by a moan from some wounded person. The sound of a baby crying fills the chamber. The demons seem to have retreated. Quickly, Professor Lormam begins to give orders, using his large baton to indicate where and how he wants things done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Smelter Beasts, finding it impossible to get inside the Temple due to the protection spells cast by the School Principal, begin to tire of trying to break down the doors. Now, players are free to walk around the School (use the map to see descriptions of the rooms). The frequency of encounters with lurking Smelter Beasts will become less as time goes on, except in the specific encounters described for each room. If players are not in the Temple, use this table if they want to get around inside the Academy:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Nº Turns</th>
<th>% Encounter</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 1-3</td>
<td>90% per room, 1d3 Smelter Beasts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 4-10</td>
<td>50% per room, 1d2 Smelter Beasts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 11-15</td>
<td>25% per room, 1d2 Smelter Beasts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 16+</td>
<td>5% per room, 1 Smelter Beast</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<p>The School’s principal, Professor Lormam, has cast a protection spell over all of the Temple and the Crypt, preventing teleportation, portal openings, passing through walls, doors to dimensions, and any type of transport within the protected areas. He also proposes taking turns to watch over the barricades on the doors to the Temple in groups of three men every four hours. Lastly, he orders the moving of the wounded to the Crypt.</p>
<p>Both priests, using spells, and Miss Bilwa, using her arsenal of potions, can heal players if needed. If characters ask, Miss Bilwa can give two average wound-healing potions to each player if they leave the Temple or the School on a mission.</p>
<p>Show the players the map of the School and their current location. Now, they are free to interact with survivors and teachers in order to gather the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are students <a href="#locked in">locked in</a> in Sergeant Menzal’s room (32).</li>
<li>There is a traitor in the school who has opened the portals. This should lead players to <a href="encounter.html?param=10">Glaucom’s Quarters</a> (10).</li>
<li>In <a href="encounter.html?param=5">The Library</a> (4) there is a book that may contain information about what type of monsters have attacked the School. </li>
<li>Players can also find out about Miss Bilwa’s problems and her accelerated ageing. If for any reason players start to spy on her, at some point Miss Bilwa will use the secret door to the Temple Crypt in order to get to Professor Nizgul’s room via the <a href="encounter.html?param=27">Underground Passages</a>.</li>
<li>Players can try to steal the School’s riches by going to the <a href="#c-mara-del-tesoro">Chamber of Treasures</a></li>
<li>If characters want to leave the compound, go to <a href="encounter.html?param=8">Finding Doris</a></li>
<li>They themselves can find the secret door used by Miss Bilwa that leads to the <a href="encounter.html?param=27">Underground Passages</a>. It is very well hidden and requires a <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html">Spot</a> (DC 25) or <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html">Search</a> check (DC 15). </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="talking-to-teachers">TALKING TO TEACHERS</h2>
<p>If players talk to teachers at the School, they will receive the following information. In the event that they get lost, give them the chunks of information from Miss Bilwa and Professor Roniam. Neither Professor Glaucom nor Professor Nizgul are in the Crypt.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Professor Lormam</strong>: The School’s principal does not manage to figure out the reason for the attack, nor the nature of the monsters involved. He is aware, though, that the assault came from a powerful Dispel Magic spell that has destroyed the Academy’s arcane defenses. His position is that of waiting for outside help and trying to survive in the Crypt. He has sent a magic message to the city’s authorities to alert them to the danger.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sargeant Menzal</strong>: A man of action, the Sergeant does not care what type of monsters attacked the School nor what their reasons were for doing so - he is suggesting forming a group of brave men to go after the Smelter Beasts, clearing each room in turn. He believes there will be time for questions later.
If he is questioned about the property deeds and money hidden in his room, the Sergeant becomes very angry about his privacy being invaded, and explains that he recently used his life savings to acquire a farm where he can retire. If he is asked about the master key that is also hidden in his room, he will eventually confess that he has been stealing money from the Chamber of Treasures to ensure he has a good retirement. If this information is revealed, Professor Lormam reprimands Menzal for his actions and informs him that when the siege of the School is over, he will be brought to justice.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Miss Bilwa</strong>:  She has received a telepathic message from one of the students sheltering in Sergeant Menzal’s room, and warns them that they will not be able to resist the demons’ attack for much longer. One of the students is seriously injured.
Also, players will be able to find out about Miss Bilwa’s problems regarding her accelerated ageing. A <a href="SRD_Sense_Motive_Skill.html">Sense Motive</a> check (DC 14) will indicate that Miss Bilwa is particularly nervous, and that it is not necessarily due to the attack on the School. If players take the time to spy on her, at some point, Miss Bilwa will slip out of the Crypt via the secret door that leads to the laboratory of <a href="encounter.html?param=6">Professor Nizgul</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Professor Roniam</strong>: The librarian stays quiet until, if no one else has said it, he alerts them to the nature of the attack. To him, it is clear that there is a traitor in the School, as someone had to open the portals the Smelter Beasts came in through. He may also recommend searching for a book entitled ‘Unmentionable Creatures of the Multiverse Abyss’, which may shed some light on the nature of the attackers. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Professor Glaucom</strong>: The portal expert is the most obvious suspect. When characters decide to interrogate Glaucom, they will realize that he is not in the Temple or the Crypt, although many people swore they saw him alive after the attack in the School’s corridors.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Professor Nizgul</strong>: The necromancer was last seen facing down the Smelter Beasts in the library during the attack. If players go there, they will find the professor’s body.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="talking-to-survivors">TALKING TO SURVIVORS</h2>
<p>The survivors speculate all kinds of theories as to the origin of the attack, but they have very little relevant information. The following clues may be obtained from the students and the guards.</p>
<ul>
<li>They hear one student suggest to another that they should escape the School by climbing up onto the roof through one of the chimneys in the dining room or the skylight in the Observatory.</li>
<li>A guard comments that the attack is probably due to the huge treasure the School keeps in an underground chamber.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="headcount-of-losses">HEADCOUNT OF LOSSES</h2>
<p>If players are interested, the following have died or are missing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professor Nizgul and Professor Glaucom: Missing </li>
<li>First year students: 4 out of 6 are missing</li>
<li>Second year students: 8 out of 14 are missing</li>
<li>Final year students: 4 out of 10 are missing</li>
<li>School Guards: 11 out of 19 are missing</li>
<li>Couple of cooks: Missing</li>
<li>Refugees: 300 out of 400 are missing</li>
<li>Priests: 3 out of 7 are missing</li>
<li>Prisoners: 4 out of 8 are missing</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="locked-in">LOCKED IN</h2>
<p>Some of the School’s students are trapped in Sergeant Menzal’s room. A group of Smelter Beasts is guarding the door, preventing the students from leaving. If players want to save them, they must go to the place and move the students somewhere safe. Players can choose any route that they think is quick and safe for completing the mission. Both Professor Lormam and Sergeant Menzal will agree that the characters should attempt the rescue. Characters who were residents of the School will know the possible routes to Sergeant Menzal’s room.</p>
<p>If they decide to go through the interior of the School, they will encounter a group of demons besieging the door to the encounter <a href="encounter.html?param=20">Lock In Students</a>.</p>
<p>If they decide to cross the <a href="encounter.html?param=9">Weapons Courtyard</a>, they will find another group of demons. If players choose this route, they can ask Professor Lormam for magical help to get through the wall that separates the Courtyard from Menzal’s room, and thus avoid the Smelter Beasts guarding the door in the corridor. Lormam will call a student named <a href="./lugares.html?param=@npcs&amp;room=4">Natso</a>, who has memorized a <a href="SRD_Disintegrate.html">Disintegrate</a> spell that he can use to open a gap in the wall so that the locked-in students can go out onto the Courtyard.</p>
<h2 id="chamber-of-treasures">CHAMBER OF TREASURES</h2>
<p>Some of the character players may know the location of the <a href="encounter.html?param=7">Chamber of Treasures</a>. If you used the pre-generated hooks, Wilbur knows the entrance from the Principal’s Office, which leads to the School’s subterranean passages.</p>

<li><a href="./npcs/wardogs.html">4 Smelter Beasts</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Four of the invaders into the School are roaming the Library (4) following the first attack. They are still lurking, crouched under the piles of wood that were once bookshelves, waiting for their victims.
Read this to the players when they enter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deathly silence and pitch blackness reign in the School’s Great Library.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If players use a light source:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The demons that passed through here destroyed everything in their path, leaving most of the bookshelves and tables smashed to pieces in heaps of wood and paper. The portal that was opened here, through which the invaders entered, has vanished. In its place, a huge crater has been dug into the ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allow players <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html">Spot</a> checks in order to see that the monsters are hiding beneath the piles of wood.
They can also use some kind of <a href="SRD_Knowledge_Skill.html">Knowledge</a> to realize that the piles of wood have been conveniently constructed.</p>
<p>Looking for the book that the Librarian asked for will alert the Beasts to the players’ presence. Due to the low light conditions and the state of the bookcase where the book is kept, players must use a <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html">Search</a> check (DC 12).</p>
<p>If players investigate the crater, they will find that the Smelter Beasts have dug into the earth and created a tunnel leading toward the city. If they go down and continue to walk through the tunnel, they will see it forking quickly and repeatedly, creating an underground maze. If players persist in investigating underground, they must face continuous waves of Smelter Beasts. Every 20 meters, approximately, there is an exit to the surface which the Beasts are using to pounce on the city’s inhabitants. The exit can come out onto a street or inside a building; this is random.</p>
<h1 id="tactics">TACTICS</h1>
<p>The Smelter Beasts are hiding under the piles of wood and will jump out at anyone who walks by them. They have a +1 bonus <a href="SRD_Hide_Skill.html">Hide</a> and they will try to <a href="SRD_Initiative.html#Surprise">surprise</a> the players.

<h2 id="books-of-interest">BOOKS OF INTEREST</h2>
<p>Searching without an index is difficult, but players can locate any book that may be of interest to them making a <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html">Search</a> (DC 12) check.

<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Depending on what they came to the Library for, players can continue <a href="encounter.html?param=4">Searching for the culprits</a> </p>
<p>If players find <em>Unmentionable Creatures of the Multiverse Abyss</em> read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extract salvaged from Gulimrrar’s Diary on his Journeys through the Abyss </p>
<p>… the cavern was dug out lengthwise and quickly forked into countless pitch-black passages. Light from my torch illuminated the walls and bounced off the grooves, creating a tapestry that looked like thick tree roots. I ran my hand along the surface and found it to be soft and smooth, as if the rock had melted on exposure to some very high temperature...  </p>
<p>… turning a corner, I stopped dead. There, with its back to me, was a four-legged creature, carving out a path for itself through solid rock. The earth dematerialized before it, and it advanced unhindered. The creature was the size of a large dog. Its skin was metallic and its hooves, like a horse’s, made little sparks fly as they struck the stone. Two curved horns like those of a ram flanked its head, and long, sharp spikes rose from its back...</p>
<p>...the animal turned around, and I saw its fiery red eyes looking in my direction. I flattened myself against the wall and held my breath. I was sure it could not have seen me, but it still seemed to know I was spying on it, and it rushed at me. I unsheathed Tzoral, prayed to Salandir, and prepared to fight for my life...</p>
<p>… I was still looking for a way out of those godforsaken tunnels of the Abyss, when I again came across those strange beasts that melted the rock in their path. This time they were in an enormous cave; dozens of them were resting, half asleep. After several minutes deliberating over whether to turn around and find another path, or try to slip past them unnoticed, some dwarf-like and fat demon with a shapeless body and short limbs appeared in another of the passages that opened into the cave. I don’t know if he spoke to the beasts with words or with magic, but when he lifted his small arm, they all sprang into motion and began to dig more tunnels where the jiggling creature was pointing...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the text has been read, players can draw their own conclusions and also make some type of related <a href="SRD_Knowledge_Skill.html">Knowledge</a> check to find out, at the discretion of the Master, the Smelter Beasts’ basic abilities.  </p>

<p></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Professor Nizgul" tags="encounter @nizgul" position="1504,429" size="100,100"></p>
<h1 id="situation">SITUATION</h1>
<p>Players can get to Nizgul’s room via the trapdoor located in the Library Archive (9) or by the underground river. They can also discover the secret door in the corridor that leads into the Chamber of Treasures, in the School’s <a href="encounter.html?param=27">Underground Passages</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You go into a room where the air is heavy and the humidity makes it difficult to breathe. You are in Professor Nizgul’s laboratory. It has been turned upside down, as if someone had wrecked the room in a fit of rage. In the center, a marble table streaked with dried blood dominates the room. To one side, a long stone writing desk serves as storage for all sorts of stills, ingredients for spells, and age-old books, while on the opposite wall, a series of shelves house an ample collection of books. But all these details pale into insignificance next to the bizarre image on the wall in front of you. Five huge vats contain putrefying creatures, submerged in a green and bubbling solution with froth floating at the top of the tanks. Next to them, a ladder leads up to one of the classrooms on the upper level. Suddenly, the silence is broken by the sound of a glass vial smashing onto the floor. The sound is coming from behind the south wall door. Carefully picking your way across a floor littered with broken jars, you approach the door. From the other side, you hear more glass being smashed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creatures in the tanks are failed necromantic experiments of Nizgul’s and are quite harmless. On the other side of the door, Miss Bilwa is ransacking the other room.</p>
<p>Read the following when players open the door:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This door leads into a small storage room, lined with shelves groaning under the weight of countless bottles and jars. In the room, a person wrapped up in a dark greenish-brown cape is nervously checking each of the jars. They are opening jars one after another, looking inside, and tossing them to the ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the players see this person’s face, read the following and show them the picture of the old woman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a very old woman, whose weathered and wrinkled face tells of a life lived much longer than nature intended. But you recognize her eyes. It is Miss Bilwa!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This encounter can be played in two different ways. </p>
<h3 id="players-come-to-look-for-the-elixir-of-truth">Players come to look for the Elixir of Truth</h3>
<p>The alchemist confesses that she is actually over 200 years old, and that she has managed to stay young thanks to Eternal Life potions that she concocted with ingredients given to her by Professor Nizgul. Bilwa also admits that the old necromancer would play games with her, and that it has been a year since he stopped giving her the things she required. Consequently, the potion’s magic effects have begun to wear off. With Nizgul’s death, Miss Bilwa does not have much time before the incantation completely disappears and she turns into dust, so she needs the players to find the materials before it is too late and she dies. She tells the players she will give them the Elixir of Truth to give to Doris if they find the ingredient she needs to create her Youth Potion. She needs the teeth of someone who has been dead for as long as she has been avoiding death: 214 years exactly. For this, players must go to the City Cemetery and find a corpse that has been dead for that long. Miss Bilwa is very agitated and fears for her life, so she will not hand over the Elixir of Truth until the players find her ingredient for her.</p>
<h3 id="if-they-do-not-go-to-find-the-elixir-of-truth">If they do not go to find the Elixir of Truth</h3>
<p>Miss Bilwa will tell the same story as above, and try to influence (even <a href="SRD_Charm_Person.html">Charm</a>) the players so that they help her find the ingredient she needs for her Youth Potion.</p>
<p>In either case, and if players agree to help her, Miss Bilwa offers to help them steal magical weapons from the Chamber of Treasures, as she believes that without them, the characters will not be able to take on the spirits that protect the cemetery. She will not mention the spirits unless she is asked directly, and she suggests stealing the weapons simply with the excuse that they may need them, without specifying why. The sorceress will accompany the players to the Chamber of Treasures, to stop them from stealing more than they need.</p>
<p>To locate the corpse needed by Miss Bilwa, the best place to go is the City Cemetery. Pickaxes and shovels can be easily found inside the School.</p>

<p>The School of Magic has a Chamber of Treasures, where the Principal keeps financial resources and other items of value. Players can get to this location either by chance, because one of the characters knows of its existence, or with the help of the information given to them by Miss Bilwa. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A huge polished metal plate blocks your path and light from your torches reflects off the golden rivets fixing the plate to the walls. In its center, you see a lock and a circle with numbers. It looks like some kind of mechanism controlled by a rotating wheel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The numbers and the wheel are nothing more than decorations designed to confuse thieves. All you need to open the door is the correct key.</p>
<h2 id="gaining-access">Gaining access</h2>
<p>Players must open the lock and deactivate the trap of the Chamber of Treasures’ door in order to get inside. If the trap is triggered, a ray of light will shoot from the door and hit whoever is in front of it.</p>
<p>Players can deactivate the trap with <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html">Search</a> / <a href="SRD_Disable_Device_Skill.html">Disable Device</a> (DC 13) checks. If it is not dismantled, it will activate a <a href="SRD_Scorching_Ray.html">Scorching Ray</a> spell, which is a ray that causes 3d6 points of damage to whoever is handling the door in front of it. Afterwards, the door requires an <a href="SRD_Open_Lock_Skill.html">Open Lock</a> check (DC 15) in order to get inside the Chamber of Treasures.</p>
<p>Players can also use the master key that Sergeant Menzal was keeping in his quarters to open the door. There is another key, in Principal Lormam’s possession, but this is difficult to get hold of. If one of these two keys is used, the trap will not be activated.</p>
<p>If players try to <a href="SRD_Breaking_and_Entering.html#Breaking_and_Entering">Break the Door</a>, this will be quite difficult as it has 60 strike points of and a resistance of 12.</p>

<h1 id="-cr-1-srd_xp-html-situation">(<a href="SRD_XP.html">CR 1</a>) SITUATION</h1>
<p>If it is the second time players have left the city, go to <a href="#saliendo-por-segunda-vez">Leaving for the second time</a>. </p>
<p>If it is the first time, continue here: 
Characters must leave the School at some point, either to visit the city or to head to the Cemetery or the White Whale. The only exit door is on the Courtyard. Other possible exits are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The skylight in the <a href="./lugares.html?param=@escuela-map&amp;room=5">Library Observatory</a>: they can use the ropes that Wilbur used to get inside the School. </p>
</li>
<li><p>One of the School’s chimneys: It is necessary to use a <a href="SRD_Climb_Skill.html">Climb</a> check (DC 10) to climb up the inside of a chimney. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The passageway to the <a href="encounter.html?param=19">Watchtower</a> </p>
</li>
<li><p>Navigating the <a href="encounter.html?param=27">Underground Passages</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>If they have cleared the monsters from the Courtyard, this will be the simplest route. If not, they must face the monsters on the <a href="encounter.html?param=9">Weapons Courtyard</a>. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is the first time players have been out onto the street, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not yet light out, and the streets of Sâlorium are usually quiet at this time. But not today. Dozens of screams coming from all over the city rip through the air, warning of the danger posed by the horde of demons that spewed forth from portals in the School of Magic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players must be careful moving around the streets. Groups of <a href="./npcs/wardogs.html">Smelter Beasts</a> are roaming the city in search of victims, and hundreds more are waiting beneath the cobbled streets in the tunnels they are building under the city.
Players must be aware that at any time, a Smelter Beast could leap out as they turn a corner, or that the ground could open up and send them plummeting toward certain death. Looting or any necessity other than moving around on the rooftops is a high-risk activity.</p>
<p>Players will have to come up with a safe way of moving around the city. The simplest way to avoid the encounters is to go via Sâlorium’s rooftops. If this does not occur to them, allow a <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html">Spot</a> (DC 8) checking order for them to realize that beasts do not go up on the rooftops. If they travel on the ground, the probability of encounters will depend on their <a href="SRD_Hide_Skill.html">Hide</a> skill. Allow positive bonuses if they are creative.</p>

<h2 id="leaving-for-the-second-time">Leaving for the second time</h2>
<p>Players must leave the School. It is daylight and the city’s forces have reorganized themselves in order to take on the <a href="./npcs/wardogs.html">Smelter Beasts</a>. A great battle is being fought in the northern area of the city, where demons have descended en masse to take the men on, so players must not encounter any enemy on their journey to the White Whale.</p>
<p>Read the following just after they leave the School:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You watch a group of around 20 demons running up the street in a herd, pushing and jostling each other in their eagerness to reach their destination. You realize that some of the monsters are aware of your presence, but they ignore you and continue their chaotic race.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Smelter Beasts are heading to join in battle. If characters do not follow them, at some point they will hear noises from the fight, but if they do not go near they will not see the combat (in which case read only the first part of the following description). If, on the other hand, players follow the demons, or later go near to the battle, read the whole description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sound of fighting becomes more obvious with every step you take. An enormous battle is being fought a few streets over, nearer and nearer to your position.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="if-players-reach-the-battle-">If players reach the battle:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A hellish scene is being painted before your eyes. The City Guard, along with any citizens brave enough, are taking on the horde of demons who throw themselves kamikaze-style into the lines of halberdiers, ignoring the damage they sustain and with the sole objective of taking down as many of the city’s defenders as possible. All around, huge craters are opening in the ground, swallowing up entire groups of men who disappear into the black bowels of the earth. The cries of the soldiers and the grunts of the monsters are lost in the sound of steel weapons striking the beasts’ metallic hides, sending sparks flying. Blood and soil mix together in a quagmire upon which a battle between man and abomination is deciding the fate of Sâlorium</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players may want to take part in the battle. If so, assume that each player will be taking on one to two Smelter Beasts at a time. Each time the player finishes their enemies, other such beasts will take their place. If players persist in staying in the battle and manage to survive, after an hour of intense battle they will see the monsters defeated. However, the price of saving Sâlorium has been too high, as the city’s forces have been impaired so that they can no longer pose a threat to Gramdum Elojia’s plans.</p>

</ul>
<p>Players can opt for trying to get to Menzal’s room (32) by crossing the Weapons Courtyard (1). They can also cross it to try and get outside. Read the following when they are about to enter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You find yourselves in the abandoned School Courtyard. The camp has been razed to the ground by the hordes of beasts and dozens of bodies litter the ground. The attackers also smashed the access doors to the complex, and tracks suggest that hundreds of them went out into the city. But what most strikes you is a huge crater that has opened up in the middle of the Courtyard</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="tactics">TACTICS</h1>
<p>The demons are still hidden (<a href="SRD_Hide_Skill.html">Hide</a> +1 bonus): one of them, among the wrecked tents, will jump out if any of the players try to go through the exit door to the city. Another of them, hiding in the crater, will attack if any ill-advised player peers into the hole. The other two are underground and are waiting for someone to pass over them or through adjacent boxes. They will try to attack in unison and capture as many enemies as possible.</p>
<h1 id="terrain">TERRAIN</h1>
<p>If players investigate the crater, they will see that the Smelter Beasts have dug out the earth and created two tunnels. One leads toward the city, and the other toward where the two monsters are hiding under the courtyard. If they go down and investigate the path leading toward the city, they will see that it quickly forks repeatedly, creating an underground labyrinth. If players persist in moving around underground, they will face continuous waves of Smelter Beasts. Every 20 meters, approximately, there is an exit to the surface which the demons have used to pounce on the city’s inhabitants. The exit can come out onto a street or inside a building; this is random.</p>

<h1 id="-cr-2-srd_xp-html-investigating-the-scene">(<a href="SRD_XP.html">CR 2</a>) INVESTIGATING THE SCENE</h1>
<p>After finding out that Professor Glaucom is missing, players head to his quarters (10).
The door is closed, and opening it requires an <a href="SRD_Open_Lock_Skill.html">Open Lock</a> check (DC 21) or <a href="SRD_Breaking_and_Entering.html#Breaking_and_Entering">Break the Door</a> of 8 resistance and 30 strike points.</p>
<p>When they enter the room, read the following (the text is an adaptation of a description which appears in the novel “Love in the Time of Cholera” by Gabriel García Márquez): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is inevitable: the scent of bitter almonds always reminds you of the fate of a troubled life. You smell it as soon as you enter the pitch-black room. Professor Glaucom, a disabled war veteran and an erudite and gracious chess adversary, has freed himself from the torments of his memory with a cloud of cyanide. You find the corpse covered with a blanket in the camp bed where he had always slept, near to a footstool with the bucket he had used to vaporize the poison. On the floor next to the camp bed is the prostrate body of a black, white-chested Great Dane, and next to it are the Professor’s crutches. Any chink of light entering the room has been stuffed with rags or sealed off with black card, heightening the oppressive denseness. There is a table covered with bottles and unlabeled jars, and two bowls of hulled pewter. There are scrolls and old books everywhere and piles of boxes housing jars of unidentifiable liquids, everything preserved by a diligent hand</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players now have the option of investigating different aspects of the room.</p>
<ul>
<li>If characters investigate the body of the deceased man, read the following:<blockquote>
<p>Professor Glaucom is completely naked, stiff and bent, with his eyes open and his skin blue. He looks fifty years older than he was the night before. His eyes are glazed over, his hair and beard yellowing, and his abdomen is criss-crossed with an old scar sewn up with bulky knots. His torso and arms are as thick as a galley slave’s due to his getting around on crutches, but his useless legs look like an orphaned child’s. </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After characters investigate the room and body, a young student, Illius de Torak, a friend of Yonse’s, runs into the room and throws himself over his teacher’s body in tears. Illius was Glaucom’s favorite, and he had taken him under his wing as his personal assistant. Players can talk to Illius when he has calmed down. A conversation with him will reveal the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Professor had been behaving erratically for a week or two. He no longer had any relationship with Illius, and of late had pushed him away completely.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Illius knows from what other students have told him that Professor Glaucom was seen wandering the School at night for no apparent reason.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Illius, worried about his teacher, spent a couple of nights spying on Glaucom and followed him to a dank-smelling inn at the dock, where the Professor spent the night. Illius suspected he was making use of the services of a lady of the night.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The truth is that Illius was not following Glaucom but Doris, the shapeshifter who took the Professor’s place. Doris visited the White Whale inn that night to receive instructions from a messenger of her master.</p>
<h2 id="examining-the-body">Examining the Body</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>A <a href="SRD_Heal_Skill.html">Heal</a> check will reveal the following information about cyanide: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DC 10</strong>: Liquid or gas hydrogen cyanide and its alkaline salts can enter the body through inhalation, ingestion, or absorption through the eyes or skin. The level of absorption through skin is higher when the skin is broken, thin or moistened. Cyanide salts dissolve easily and are absorbed upon contact with mucous membranes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html">Search</a> or <a href="SRD_Heal_Skill.html">Heal</a> check on the corpse will reveal the following: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DC 5</strong>: Glaucom could not have been older than 50 at the time of his death, but an old and poorly-treated war wound crossing his stomach and leaving his legs paralyzed, along with the prolonged exposure to cyanide gases, have left him looking like a 90-year-old man.</li>
<li><strong>DC 10</strong>: His eyes and mucous membranes show signs of exposure to the fatal cyanide gases. His old, poorly-treated wound was also a significant factor in the rapid absorption of the poison.</li>
<li><strong>DC 11</strong>: The camp bed sheets are damp, as if Glaucom had taken a bath before lying down.</li>
<li><strong>DC 12</strong>: The corpse is in a very advanced state of decomposition for having died such a short time ago. You would date the death as having occurred at least two weeks ago.</li>
<li><strong>DC 15</strong>: The palms of both the dead man’s hands show some almost microscopic lacerations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html">Spot</a> check on the area around the bed will reveal the following: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DC 15</strong>: 
The bucket used for vaporizing the poison is forged from bronze and must weigh at least 10 kilos - too heavy for a disabled man to move to the bed without dragging it. If scratches on the floor are searched for (DC 5), no trace is found of the bucket having been dragged across the floor. Its sharp feet would have left obvious scratches on the floor of the room.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html">Spot</a> or <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html">Search</a> check on the crutches will reveal the following: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DC 12</strong>: Both handles have small holes in where needles could have been placed. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A <a href="SRD_Heal_Skill.html">Heal</a> or <a href="SRD_Knowledge_Skill.html#Knowledge_.28Int.3B_Trained_Only.29">Nature Knowledge</a> check on the body of the Great Dane will reveal the following: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DC 15</strong>: The animal shows signs of having taken in poisonous gases, but the fact that he did not try to run away indicates that he must have died before inhaling the cyanide. If the animal is opened up (DC 10), partially digested remains of a potent poison in his stomach and intestines can be observed. He was poisoned.</li>

<ul>
<li>3 <a href="./npcs/maleantes.html">Ruffians</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Whether they travel on the ground or on the rooftops, players will arrive at a market square. At that point, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You come to a square. In order to continue on your way, you must cross it out in the open, or you could wander around in search of a more protected, but longer, route. You are struggling with the dilemma when you hear a scream. Some men run into the square, shoving and dragging several people. There are four of the men, and they have the dangerous look of the typical thugs that have taken root in the port area. The victims, three women, two children and two men, have been beaten with sticks and are pleading for their lives. It looks as if the group of bastards is trying to take advantage of the chaos in the city by massacring the weak</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players must decide whether to help the victims or ignore them. If Wilbur is in the group, he recognizes the thieves as members of “One-Eye’s Gang”. If characters decide to intervene and save the victims, the thugs approach Wilbur, revealing their relationship with the character by saying things such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hey, Wilbur! What are you doing here, you out hunting too?” or “This is our prey, get your own, idiot”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wilbur could try negotiating with them to get them to leave the victims alone, but they will flat-out refuse. When they see that confrontation is inevitable, one of them - the leader - will say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Old One-Eye isn’t going to like what you’re doing. You’ll pay for this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If players do not intervene, the thugs will kill their victims, rob them, and go back where they came from.</p>
<p>If players fight the criminals, one of the attackers in melée with a player, on feeling cornered, grabs one of the children as a human shield and threatens to kill him if he is not allowed to get away. At that moment, the ground will open up in an adjacent box to the villain and a Smelter Beast will emerge from the earth, taking the coward to the bottom of the well. A player close by can use Reflex check (DC 8) to grab the child and prevent him from being swallowed up by the hole. Then, players will have two turns to leave the zone and get to safety from the monsters rising from the new crater.</p>
<h1 id="tactics">TACTICS</h1>
<p>The thugs do not use any sophisticated tactics, they are just small-time knife-wielders. However they do value their lives above all else, and will not hesitate to use their victims as human shields if the situation requires. They are not suicidal and would rather run away or surrender than die.</p>

</ul>
<p>Players will finally arrive at the White Whale to find that the door to the inn is locked from the inside. If they want to go in, characters will have to <a href="SRD_Breaking_and_Entering.html#Breaking_and_Entering">Break the Door</a> (Resistance 5 and 20 strike points) or <a href="SRD_Climb_Skill.html">Climb</a> up to a window (DC 11). They can also call through the door and wait for Zorx, the owner of the inn, to decide to let them in. In order to convince him, characters will have to be very persuasive, as the innkeeper is deeply scared by what is happening outside.</p>
<p>Once inside, characters should search for Doris, who is in an upstairs bedroom. If players entered with permission and ask the innkeeper, he will admit that an old man matching Professor Glaucom’s description is upstairs.</p>
<p>If they entered by force, <a href="./lugares.html?param=@npcs&amp;room=5">Zorx</a> 
will face them down but will back down when he sees he is outnumbered. He does not want to die. Other clients may intervene or not, depending on the players’ level of aggression and their physical state. If they have lost a lot of life on their way to the inn, it may not be recommended for them to have another combat before facing Doris. Also, a battle downstairs would alert the shapeshifter to their presence and she would try to escape over the rooftops.</p>
<p>Doris is resting upstairs. She has just sent a message to her master via a messenger saying that she is waiting in the White Whale and has charged for the job. She is waiting for things to calm down a little in the city and will then leave as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Read the following to the players when they enter the room:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The room is the shoddy sort of room you would expect to find in such a shoddy little inn. On the bed, someone appearing to be a tired Professor Glaucom was dozing until you burst in. With an agility unusual for a disabled person, the mage jumps up next to the bed and stares at you defiantly. “Well, it looks as if there is no more need for deception, haha. You have done well, but unfortunately, you will not be leaving here alive,” he says, as his features and body change to reveal his true form</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Show the players the picture of the shapeshifter.</p>
<h1 id="tactics">TACTICS</h1>
<p>Doris is a skilful fighter and will try to eliminate the characters. If she feels outnumbered, she will try to jump out of the window onto the rooftops and flee. If she cannot, she will give in, as she values her life too highly.</p>

<p>Doris will be captured by the players, but she will not reveal anything about her plans or who sent her to open the portals. If looked around, the players will find a bag of gems worth 500mo. The worn old pouch has the symbol of the Mother of Demons on it (show illustration).</p>
<p>If characters wish to get more information from Doris, they must do so by magic means. Miss Bilwa can prepare an Elixir of Truth, but for that they must go back to the School.</p>
<h2 id="doris-s-treasure">DORIS’S TREASURE</h2>
<p>Under the bed, Doris is keeping a sack containing the objects she stole from Professor Glaucom. Inside the following is found:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="SRD_Cloak_of_Resistance.html#bodyContent">Cloak of Resistance +1</a></li>
<li>1 <a href="SRD_Hold_Portal.html#bodyContent">Hold Portal scroll</a></li>

<li>A <a href="SRD_Staff_of_Passage.html#bodyContent">Staff of Passage</a> with only 2 charges left</li>
</ul>
<p>Players can opt for keeping the objects or returning them to the School. If they take them back, the School Principal will only want to recover the Staff of Passage and will pay 10,000mo for it.</p>

<h1 id="situation">SITUATION</h1>
<p>The players return to the School with Doris as their prisoner. Once more, battles in the city depend on the characters’ state of health. If they are not badly wounded, they may have an encounter with a couple of Smelter Beasts. In any case, returning to the School should be another treacherous journey, with the fear that death is waiting around every corner. If the characters get distracted, Doris could try to escape.</p>

<h2 id="miss-bilwa-s-little-problem">Miss Bilwa’s Little Problem</h2>
<p>Once inside the School, players should try to extract information from Doris. If it does not occur to them, some teacher may suggest the use of magic to do so. For this, they need an <a href="SRD_Elixir_of_Truth.html#bodyContent">Elixir of Truth</a> that only Miss Bilwa knows how to make.</p>
<p>If they have already obtained the necessary ingredients for Miss Bilwa’s Youth Potion, she will hand over the Elixir of Truth with no problems.</p>
<p>Otherwise, characters will have to look for Miss Bilwa in Professor Nizgul’s room.</p>
<p>Miss Bilwa used the secret door in the Crypt, <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html">Search</a> (DC 15), to access Nizgul’s room via the underground passages.</p>
<p>If players try to interrogate Doris through non-magical means, even torture, the shapeshifter will reveal nothing.  </p>

<p>If it is the second time players have left the city, go to <a href="#saliendo-por-segunda-vez">Leaving for the second time</a>. </p>
<p>Characters must leave the School at some point, either to visit the city or to head to the Cemetery or the White Whale. The only exit door is on the Courtyard. Other possible exits are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The skylight in the <a href="./lugares.html?param=@escuela-map&amp;room=5">Library Observatory</a>: they can use the ropes that Wilbur used to get inside the School. </p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is the first time players have been out onto the street, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not yet light out, and the streets of Sâlorium are usually quiet at this time. But not today. Dozens of screams coming from all over the city rip through the air, warning of the danger posed by the horde of demons that spewed forth from portals in the School of Magic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players must be careful moving around the streets. Groups of <a href="./npcs/wardogs.html">Smelter Beasts</a> are roaming the city in search of victims, and hundreds more are waiting beneath the cobbled streets in the tunnels they are building under the city.
Players must be aware that at any time, a Smelter Beast could leap out as they turn a corner, or that the ground could open up and send them plummeting toward certain death. Looting or any necessity other than moving around on the rooftops is a high-risk activity.</p>
<p>Players will have to come up with a safe way of moving around the city. The simplest way to avoid the encounters is to go via Sâlorium’s rooftops. If this does not occur to them, allow a <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html">Spot</a> (DC 8) skill in order for them to realize that beasts do not go up on the rooftops. If they travel on the ground, the probability of encounters will depend on their <a href="SRD_Hide_Skill.html">Hide</a> skill. Allow positive bonuses if they are creative.</p>

<h2 id="leaving-for-the-second-time">Leaving for the Second Time</h2>
<p>Players must leave the School. It is daylight out and the city’s forces have reorganized themselves to take on the Smelter Beasts. A great battle is being fought in the northern area of the city, where demons have descended en masse to take the men on, so players must not encounter any enemy on their journey to the Cemetery.</p>
<p>Read the following shortly after they leave the School: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You watch a group of around 20 demons running up the street in a herd, pushing and jostling each other in their eagerness to reach their destination. You realize that some of the monsters are aware of your presence, but they ignore you and continue their chaotic race.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Smelter Beasts are heading to join in the battle. If characters do not follow them, at some point they will hear noises from the fight, but if they do not go near they will not see the combat (in which case read only the first part of the following description). If, on the other hand, players follow the demons, or later go near to the battle, read the whole description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sound of fighting becomes more obvious with every step you take. An enormous battle is being fought a few streets over, nearer and nearer to your position.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="if-players-reach-the-battle-">If players reach the battle:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A hellish scene is being painted before your eyes. The City Guard, along with any citizens brave enough, are taking on the horde of demons who throw themselves kamikaze-style into the lines of halberdiers, ignoring the damage they sustain and with the sole objective of taking down as many of the city’s defenders as possible. All around, huge craters are opening in the ground, swallowing up entire groups of men who disappear into the black bowels of the earth. The cries of the soldiers and the grunts of the monsters are lost in the sound of steel weapons striking the beasts’ metallic hides, sending sparks flying. Blood and soil mix together in a quagmire upon which a battle between man and abomination is deciding the fate of Sâlorium</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players may want to take part in the battle. If so, assume that each player will be taking on one to two Smelter Beasts at a time. Each time the player finishes their enemies, other such beasts will take their place. If players persist in staying in the battle and manage to survive, after an hour of intense battle they will see the monsters defeated. However, the price of saving Sâlorium has been too high, as the city’s forces have been impaired so that they can no longer pose a threat to Gramdum Elojia’s plans.</p>
<p>Whether or not they intervene in the battle, players should head toward <a href="encounter.html?param=15">The Cemetery</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="./npcs/fantasma.html">Lord Gimion, Wraith</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When the characters reach their destination, show them the illustration of the Cemetery and read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This place seems untouched by everything that is happening in the rest of the city. Absolute silence and peace fill the entire cemetery, as if the goings-on outside could not disturb this place of rest. A thick fog floats above the ground, reaching your knees - reaching your waist, if you are a halfling. The leaden sky allows through some meager rays of the first morning light, although most of the graveyard is still in darkness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players must locate the oldest area of the cemetery if they are to find bodies as long-dead as they need to be in order to provide an ingredient for Miss Bilwa’s potion.
When players reach that zone and locate the correct grave to dig up (marked with an X), read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A humanoid shape begins to form from the mist covering your feet. A translucent man, with a lordly manner and dressed in elegant attire, looks at you sternly. He gives a ghostly screech, and his face darkens with a terrifying expression of anger that chills you to the bone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is Lord Gimion, an old gentleman whose life after death was devoted by priests to protecting the deceased. He does not allow anyone to disturb the sleep of the dead, and he will attack anyone whose actions defile holy ground.</p>
<h1 id="tactics">TACTICS</h1>
<p>Lord Gimion will preferably attack the character or characters most involved in the process of opening graves and digging out earth.
Lord Gimion cannot be in direct sunlight, so he must stay in shaded areas. Each turn, the clouds shift around, changing which areas are shaded and which are light. Use the map at each turn and move Lord Gimion to a place that is safe for him, although this presupposes that he will not undertake any other action. If, due to this circumstance, he can move next to an enemy and attack, he will try to move to this location.
A player who spends the whole turn looking at the sky can work out which areas will be light on the next turn if he has succeeds in a <a href="SRD_Ability_Check.html#Ability_Checks">Wisdom</a> check (DC 10).</p>
<p>A character with the right equipment (shovels and pickaxes) will take 14 turns to open the grave, remove the coffin and find the dead person’s teeth. If a second characters assists them, they will take 6. A third character would only serve to hinder the process.</p>
<h2 id="the-mystery-of-the-sawuernizer-family">THE MYSTERY OF THE SAWUERNIZER FAMILY</h2>
<p>If Monak (or his story) was one of the pre-generated characters used by the players and is now in the Cemetery facing Lord Gimion, allow him to make a <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html">Spot</a> check (DC 6) when he faces the specter. If he succeeds, inform him (without the rest of the players finding out) of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you look at the ghost, you cannot avoid noticing his helmet. His ostentatious headgear is crowned by a striking symbol that you know very well. It is the same coat of arms etched onto your sword</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lord Gimion is an ancestor of Monak. If Monak decides to investigate the Cemetery, he will discover a nearby vault with the same symbol carved into the doorway. If he enters the mausoleum, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You struggle to slide across the bolt on the gate guarding the mausoleum. The interior is dusty and unkempt, with dozens of vines covering the walls and floors, embracing a red marble tomb situated in the middle of the crypt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the place is investigated a <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html">Search</a> (DC 6) check will reveal that in their day, the walls held red marble plates that have since been removed. Some of their remains stuck to the walls indicate that these plates must have made up an impressive bas-relief. Unfortunately, what little is left is not enough to show what it was.</p>
<p>If the tomb is opened, the cadaver of Lord Gimion is found inside: a heap of bones and a skull inside heavy plate armor. There is also a helmet and a bastard sword. Everything is in very poor condition due to its age, and the weaponry is useless. A <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html">Spot</a> or <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html">Search</a> check (DC 10) will reveal an engraved message on the underside of the sarcophagus lid.</p>
<p>The text is written in an archaic version of the common language, but it can be more or less translated as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Honor and blood of the Sawuernizers,<br>rest and accept peace.<br>Leave behind that which you took from the earth,<br>flesh and soul.<br>Drag away your abyssal ruins,<br>and achieve that which you could not face in life.<br>Honor and blood of the Sawuernizers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="SRD_Knowledge_Skill.html">Local History</a> check (DC 12) will reveal that the Sawuernizers were an ancient family who owned a homestead in the south of the city. Decades ago, they was one of the area’s most prominent families, but according to local legend, they suffered some misfortune and disappeared. The mystery surrounding this family continues in the Module: <strong>The Fall of the Sawuernizers</strong>.</p>

<p>The players return to the School and Miss Bilwa gives them an Elixir of Truth in exchange for the teeth extracted from the Cemetery. Now, they can interrogate Doris. <a href="SRD_Elixir_of_Truth.html#bodyContent">The Elixir</a> means that the shapeshifter cannot lie in her responses. </p>
<p>Doris knows that her master ordered her to open the portals. He gave her some small golden discs to place around the School. Doris serves the necromancer but not the Mother of Demons, and knows nothing about Rajak’s remains. She can only say that her master did not want his work on the Invader’s Mountains to be interrupted by the city’s forces.
Doris was at the inn waiting for things to calm down before leaving the city.</p>
<h2 id="the-invader-s-mountains">THE INVADER’S MOUNTAINS</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The place Doris told you about is one day’s journey away. The journey toward the location in the Invader’s Mountains is bleak. The enormous dust cloud that forced the villagers to abandon their homes has destroyed the region. All the vegetation is dead and it is rare to come across an animal there, or to hear birdsong. Every now and then you see a group of dead cows or goats who suffocated days ago on the floating dust and ash. Spirits low, you approach your destination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The walk continues until (show illustration):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You climb a hill, knowing that from the top you will have a view of the Invader’s Mountains. It is growing dark, and the top of this hill would be a good place to rest for the night - but it will be difficult for any of you to sleep a wink after what you see from the top of the hill. A head, the size of a giant’s, has badly damaged the mountains. A gigantic being’s head, with unseeing eyes and a serene expression, rests atop a huge crater. Next to it, a camp lit up with torches sleeps in the giant’s shadow.</p>

<h2 id="thief-wilbur-">THIEF (Wilbur)</h2>
<p>You have made up your mind. This is your last job for Tommy ‘One-eye’. You are sick and tired of risking your life and getting nothing more than crumbs for it. With time you have earned more recognition in the organization. You have been working for One-eye since you were six; first, as a pickpocket at the market, cutting the purse strings of unsuspecting housekeepers there to get groceries, then as a looter of sunken ships, diving into their depths before their rightful owners could reclaim the cargo. Now, you are a burglar, and you are not prepared for anyone else to take all the benefits of your theft. This is your last job for One-eye, and you are saying goodbye in style: by robbing the chambers of the City of Sâlorium’s School of Magic.</p>
<p><strong>SECRET</strong>: You know all of the School’s secrets, as you have an ally on the inside. It is your lover, Turanea - a wizard’s apprentice who is infatuated with you and whom you use to extract information about the School. She could also be useful to you as an alibi in the event that you are caught burglarizing the School. You can always claim that you are a lover blinded by passion who broke in to see his girlfriend, rather than a miserable thief who took advantage of a naïve young girl to get his big career break.</p>

<h2 id="mage-yonse-">MAGE (Yonse)</h2>
<p>Magic is wonderful. Thanks to magic, you can fly, change your appearance, or throw a flaming fireball at your enemies and finish them. Magic is like having the whole deck of cards and being able to deal yourself five aces every hand. And you are looking to be the best croupier there is. That’s why you enrolled at Sâlorium’s School of Magic - your best chance to unravel the mysteries of sorcery. You have been working hard for several months: dissecting animals, experimenting with alchemy and poring over books and scrolls on all kinds of arcane disciplines. A world of infinite possibility is opening up in front of you, and you intend to make the most of it.</p>
<p><strong>SECRET</strong>: You are descended from a corrupt bloodline - a curse on your family allows you to transform into a fearsome creature, something like a humanoid rat. Your relatives see it as a gift, but you never asked for it. As soon as you were able to see your own worth, you left the oppressive and inbred clan where your family lived, and you never looked back. After wandering aimlessly for a while, you discovered magic, and perhaps the way to cleanse your body of the horrible secret you hide. While other students of the School are sleeping, you devote your nights to researching the mysteries of lycanthropy and its possible cures, with the hope of being able to become a normal person.</p>

<h2 id="warrior-monak-">WARRIOR (Monak)</h2>
<p>Your fate seemed written: follow in the footsteps of your father, and his before him, to become just another farmer, wasting his life plowing the lowlands of Turil. But you preferred to carve out your own path. You left your small village behind less than a year ago on a golden-haired horse and carrying your father’s old sword, and arrived in the City of Sâlorium to follow your dream: to become one of those adventurers who travel the world facing incredible danger in search of fame and fortune. But it is not quite like the bards in the taverns sing about. For the moment, your good physical shape - sculpted in your family’s cornfields - has served you only to find a job as a Guard in Sâlorium’s School of Magic. It is a reasonably peaceful and easy job, with good pay and a warm bed, but it is a far cry from the ancient tombs teeming with treasures that you dreamed of when you left your village.</p>
<p><strong>SECRET</strong>: You have repeated your story so many times that you almost believe it yourself. You had to invent it to answer curious people’s questions about your past. And so, Monak and his common life story were born: a young man who left his village in search of fortune in the big wide world. It is so mundane that anyone who asks loses interest and does not ask about your past again. Because the truth is much more disturbing.
The truth is that you do not remember anything about your past. You only know that you woke up some months ago in a flattened forest clearing, in the middle of a crater, with a cold steel sword plunged into the earth nearby. Naked, lost, and hungry, you found a farm where you stole some clothes, food, and a horse, and you wandered around the lowlands until you arrived in the City of Sâlorium. After spending some time begging and thieving on the streets, you accepted the job at the School of Magic and you continue to try to unravel the mystery that is your life. The only clue to your past is in the peculiar coat of arms that decorates the crosshead of your sword.</p>

<h2 id="semi-elf-explorer-raghar-">SEMI-ELF EXPLORER (RaGhar)</h2>
<p>The tribes of the North are a barbaric place to grow up, especially when you are a woman and your mother is a weak elf taken as spoils of war by your father, an old chieftain who treated you like a curse from the gods. Your childhood as a bastard, in the shadow of your human siblings, only served to teach you the best way of following tracks and hunting vermin for the stews concocted by your tribe’s repugnant cooks. When your training was finished, it was time for you to join the army of the ascendant to the chieftain’s position - in this case, one of your half brothers, who believed it was possible to conquer the lands of the South’s more civilized towns. It was the first and last campaign in which you participated: a long march for several months, razing small populations, bringing death and destruction upon innocents. It had seemed like this time, your tribe could claim one of the most important places in the world as theirs - until reality slammed its fist down onto you like the god Groak’s. The army received its fatal blow just a few leagues away from the City of Sâlorium. An invincible force, made up of the armies of all the cities and kingdoms in the area, ended the hopes and aspirations of your people in one fell swoop, and they barely escaped from the battle now known as “the Bleeding of the Barbarians”. You were not so lucky, and ended up as one of the hundreds of prisoners condemned to work as slaves in the victors’ cities. For several years now, you have been serving the City of Sâlorium as a workhorse for the heavy jobs that no one is willing to undertake. Following the arrival of hundreds of refugees in the City, you have been sent to the School of Magic to help build a camp to shelter the newcomers. Your work consists of following your foreman’s orders, be it pitching tents or cleaning latrines. You spend the nights with your fellow workers: thieves, rapists, and other lowest of the low who are serving sentences for their crimes.</p>

<h2 id="medium-sorcerer-mr-pirs-">MEDIUM SORCERER (Mr Pirs)</h2>
<p>Mr Pirs is a visionary. Mr Pirs is a halfling like no other. Mr Pirs has stood out from the crowd since he was a child. Mr Pirs possesses magical gifts that will astound the world. Mr Pirs always refers to himself in the third person. Mr Pirs was not born to mingle with common mortals, nor with the average idiot that blights, with their stupidity and tastelessness, this crude world that surely needs to be kicked into touch. Mr Pirs sees nothing but crassness, bad manners, stupidity and tackiness. And he firmly believes that only his intervention can save all those poor unfortunate souls dragging themselves through the mud of their slipshod folly over the course of what their limited minds call ‘life’. Mr Pirs will save the world from itself, but, oh! Unfortunately, at the moment he is preoccupied with more trivial matters. It seems that Mr Pirs forgot to pay the bill at the inn where he was staying. According to the magistrates, Mr Pirs had also stalled over a few payments for a wine cellar he had bought and drained. Apparently, it had come out during the trials that Mr Pirs had also not found the time to see to a certain lady to whom he was engaged, and whom he had not seen since the day the lady’s father had given him the dowry for their marriage. Despite Mr Pirs’ protestations, tantrums and threats, which served only to add a few years onto his sentence, the judges decided it would be good for Mr Pirs to spend the next five years reflecting on his behavior while employed by the city’s forced labor program. So, Mr Pirs currently finds himself working alongside Sâlorium’s elite on the School of Magic courtyard, where he spends his mornings helping to build a camp for the refugees that arrived in the city some days ago.</p>

<h2 id="elf-priest-erundur-">ELF PRIEST (Erundur)</h2>
<p>Your kind left this continent long ago - it was too dangerous and uncivilized for the sons of Seldarine. But you stayed. In your heart, you knew that leaving this land would only make your people’s enemies stronger, and at some point they would be brave enough to attack your haven beyond the seas.
You have devoted your life to the will of the gods and you know that only by offering peace and generosity can you quash the hatred in the hearts of mortals. But you also know that there are times when the only solution is the hard and enduring elfin steel. And you are not afraid to use it.
After several months traveling the lands of the North, helping the needy, you have come to the City of Sâlorium where you are helping attend to the hundreds of refugees who have arrived in the city over the past few days.</p>
<p><strong>LA REALIDAD</strong>: </p>
<p>Years ago, you were part of a secret group of elves dedicated to investigating the cult that worships the Mother of Demons, a small, elusive sect that hates elves. Your team located one of these cult groups in a cave system beneath a faraway mountain range. You remember going inside and taking on the cult members hiding there, but in the heat of battle, you lost consciousness. When you awoke, you were horrified to find that all of your companions were dead and there was no trace of the cult members. Since then, you have devoted your efforts to locating and destroying followers of the Mother of Demons.</p>
<p>What do you know about the Mother of Demons cult?
The name of the cult is only whispered throughout the Multiverse. Hushed voices, murmuring like ancient texts, claim that the mother of demons gave birth to the Lords that govern the Abyss. Other sources go further, daring to claim that the entire demon race is descended from her. But these are only rumors that are silenced in turn when some brainless person is foolish enough to try to resolve the mystery surrounding the so-called Mother of Demons.</p>
<p>Long ago, the Mother of Demons used cunning and deception to manipulate the prince of the elf gods into accepting a terrible pact. As a result of the agreement, an entire generation of elf children was trapped in the layer of the abyss governed by the Mother of Demons. This allows her servants to hunt them down one by one for sports. Since then, the layer has become a battlefield between the demonic forces, and celestial beings come to protect the young elves. The battle has been going on for millennia.</p>

<ul>
<li>Horde of <a href="./npcs/wardogs.html">Smelter Beasts</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using the <a href="./encounter.html?param=2">hooks</a> for the pre-generated characters, the attack will take place with three of the characters inside the school (Yonse, Wilbur and Monak) and another three on the Courtyard (Erundur, Raghar and Mr Pirs). It is not recommended for any player to start in a room any further east than room 16, or they will become involved in the attack on the library.</p>
<p>If you are not using the hooks, read the following texts depending on where the players are at the start.</p>
<p>For those who begin as <strong>prisoners, refugees or guards on the Courtyard (1)</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Night falls, and after a few short hours of peace, a scream wakes you. Suddenly, a great flash of light begins to draw on the ground a circle of incandescent light surrounded by arcane symbols. Then a whirlwind forms above it - the air begins to whip round wildly, dragging tents, barrels and all kinds of tools lying nearby.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those who begin in <strong>the Library (4)</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a flash of light in the center of the Library, a circle of incandescent light begins to draw itself on the floor, surrounded by arcane symbols, while a whirlwind forms above it. The air begins to whip round wildly, dragging scrolls, small books and the dust from the shelves. The wind is gathering force and knocks over two enormous bookshelves that crash loudly to the floor, smashing into pieces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those who begin in any <strong>other part of the School</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You hear screams which seem to be coming from the (Courtyard or Library, whichever is closer to players’ location). A terrifying battle is being fought!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="./npcs/wardogs.html">Smelter Beasts</a> sent to attack the School of Magic spill forth from portals appearing in the Library and on the Courtyard, on a mission to destroy the compound and everything in their path. Once they have achieved this, they will continue to spread chaos throughout the city. The horde spewing forth from the portals seems endless - players’ objective is to protect and save as many people as possible and take them to a safe place. It must be made clear to the players that <strong>it is impossible for them to stop the attack</strong>, as if they take on the hordes, they will end up being killed. Their priority is to find a safe haven.</p>
<p>Before the portals opened, Gramdum Elojia sent one of his most competent sorcerers to cast a powerful <a href="SRD_Greater_Dispel_Magic.html#bodyContent">Dispel Magic</a> spell on the School to deactivate the protections that might have defended the Academy. As a result of this Epic spell, all the School’s torches are extinguished, plunging the building into the blackest <a href="SRD_Vision_and_Light.html#bodyContent">Darkness</a>. Any individual spells the players may have had are dispelled, unless they were cast by a character higher than level 21. The mage responsible for the spell is on the outskirts of the city, and once his task is completed he will return to the Invader’s Mountains.</p>
<h2 id="attack-on-the-courtyard">Attack on the Courtyard</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When the swirling vortex vanishes, a door of red, sizzling energy appears before your eyes. Dozens of four-legged creatures spill out of it at great speed. These creatures are covered head to toe with a hard, metallic hide. Their extremities end in hard hooves that send sparks flying as they hit the ground. A pair of twisted horns sprout from their skulls level with their mouths, and sharp spikes rise up from their backs. The monsters move at incredible speed and destroy everything in their path, attacking and devastating whatever is nearby. There are so many of them that they are trampling each other, the creatures at the bottom crushed to death under the weight of their comrades. Others speed away, dragging along everything that falls into their path. If they had human faces, you would say they were grinning. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prisoners are tied to some posts in the middle of the Courtyard and are able to take advantage of the confusion to loosen their ropes. They free themselves by climbing the posts and slipping the knots off the top (<a href="SRD_Climb_Skill.html">Climb</a> DC 5). They can work as a team and pull down the posts (<a href="SRD_Ability_Check.html#Ability_Checks">Strength</a> DC 10) or simply wriggle free from the knots (<a href="SRD_Escape_Artist_Skill.html">Escape Artist</a> DC 10) They can also use their social skills to convince one of the refugees to give them a cutting weapon so they can free themselves (<a href="SRD_Diplomacy_Skill.html">Diplomacy</a> or <a href="SRD_Intimidate_Skill.html">Intimidate</a> DC 7).</p>
<p>If none of these actions is successful, it is possible that a Smelter Beast will knock the post down, allowing them to escape.</p>
<p>The members of the School will be pushed by the invaders toward the East area of the Courtyard, where students and teachers will erect a series of barricades to prevent the Smelter Beasts from entering the Temple. The demons’ mission is to isolate the School from the town, so they will mercilessly attack anyone attempting to flee the Academy, but not those who shelter inside it.</p>
<p>On the way to their shelter, players may come across one or more of these situations, at the discretion of the DM.</p>

<p>If characters go through the school toward the room where the students are trapped, they will encounter three Smelter Beasts lurking in the corridor outside rooms 30, 31 and 32. If they go across the Weapons Courtyard (1) and enter Sergeant Menzal’s room (32) by magical means, they will avoid the encounter.</p>
<p>Read the following to players when they are in the corridor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is not one chink of light in this long corridor. The only sign of life in the vicinity is the sound of incessant banging from the end of the corridor, rattling the walls. Suddenly, the noise stops and silence falls. It is as if time had stopped.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="tactics">TACTICS</h1>
<p>The banging is coming from two Smelter Beasts who are ramming the door to the room of Sergeant Menzal (32). When players approach the box marked with an X on the map, the monsters will detect the vibrations of their footsteps and will stop battering the door, ready to attack. The third Smelter Beast, in room 31, will wait one turn after combat begins before he acts, trying to catch players unaware on the side where he can cause the most damage.</p>

<p>The guard sergeant’s room is a simple and tidy bedroom.</p>
<p>Once inside room 32, players can free the students. They are still alive, as are the married couple of cooks, but most of them are in a critical condition.</p>
<p>If they search the room, a <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html">Search</a> (DC 11) check will reveal a false bottom in the trunk. Inside, there is a metal box with a <a href="SRD_Open_Lock_Skill.html#bodyContent">lock</a> (DC 16). Inside that, there are 200 gold coins and the property deeds to a ranch in the south of the continent that was recently acquired by Sergeant Menzal. Wrapped in a small velvet cloth is a key: it is a copy of Professor Lormam’s master key, which can open every door in the School. Some time ago, Menzal got hold of the key, and since then has been siphoning off small amounts of money from the Chamber of Treasures. It is thanks to this “extra income” that he has managed to scrape together enough money to buy a farm where he can retire.</p>
<h2 id="return-to-the-temple">RETURN TO THE TEMPLE</h2>
<p>If players return to the Temple through the inside of the School, once they have left behind the Gallery of Spirits (15), and entered the corridor with the entries to the Temple (3), read this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a tremor and a deafening noise, dozens of Smelter Beasts from the portal in the Library jostle to get out, shoving and crashing into each other and the walls in their eagerness to hunt you down. Racing each other to get out, they only hamper their own progress, forming a bottleneck; they trample each other, some running out from the clamor of grunts. Those who do run after you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players must run down the corridor to get to the Temple. Do not let them take the horde on, as this would be certain death. The situation should simply serve to remind the players of the danger posed by wandering around the corridors of the School.</p>
<p>If players return to the Temple (2) via the School Courtyard (1), once they have arrived at the door to the sanctuary, read this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following a tremor and a deafening noise, dozens of Smelter Beasts from the portal in the Library jostle to get out, shoving and crashing into each other and the walls in their eagerness to hunt you down. Racing each other to get out, they only hamper their own progress, forming a bottleneck; they trample each other, some running out from the clamor of grunts. Those who do run after you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once inside the Temple, read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The guards close the door behind you before any monsters can get inside the Temple. With a sigh of relief, you collapse from the exertion and satisfaction of having saved a number of lives, but you are quickly overcome by the anxiety of how close you came to being killed by the demons.</p>

<h3 id="where-to-find-him">Where to find him</h3>

<p><img src="./images/magisters/glaucom.jpg" alt="medium"></p>
<p>Professor Glaucom is a disabled old man who gets around on crutches. The sharpest tongues say that the reason he became interested in the study of portals was to find ways of getting around despite his disability. His face is haggard with the weight of the years, and he always wears padded clothing that protects him in case his crutches fail him and he falls.</p>

<p>Professor Roniam is the School’s librarian. He is an absent-minded old man who always seems far away, except for everything related to the control and organization of the thousands of volumes and scrolls that make up the Great Library. He is a heavy pipe smoker, a habit which has annoyed him on more than one occasion, when ash has fallen onto one of his precious scrolls.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-find-him">Where to find him</h3>

<p>Sergeant Menzal is a war veteran who has since been working as chief of security at the School of Magic. He is a hard-faced, tyrannical man who likes to get drunk and beat his subordinates. Despite his violent nature, the School’s Principal allows him to keep his job, as his military knowledge makes up for his fiery personality. Menzal is an intimidating man almost two meters tall, in very good shape for his age and rarely seen without his heavy armor.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-find-him">Where to find him</h3>
<p>When the attack on the School begins, Menzal is asleep in his room. He will quickly join his men at the Guards’ Barracks and try to organize the Academy’s defenses.

<h1 id="the-south-courtyard-1-">The South Courtyard (1)</h1>
<p>The School’s great courtyard has been used as a receiving area for the refugees that have arrived in Sâlorium. Dozens of tents cover the ground. An old, horseless stable is the only built structure on the lot. On the Courtyard, there is also a post for tying up prisoners, and the well that supplies the School with water.</p>
<h1 id="the-temple-of-magic-2-">The Temple of Magic (2)</h1>
<p>This temple is dedicated to the Goddess of Magic. Every morning, a priest comes in from the city to officiate a ceremony attended by teachers and professors.</p>
<p>The temple contains five statues. A <a href="SRD_Knowledge_Skill.html#Knowledge_.28Int.3B_Trained_Only.29">Religion</a> (DC 5) check reveals that four of them - those that go along the walls - represent lesser servants of the Goddess of Magic. The fifth, behind the altar, is a humanized effigy of the Deity. This last sculpture has been knocked onto the floor and is smashed into pieces.</p>
<p>The Temple before the attack:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This cold temple dedicated to the Goddess of Magic is a quiet and peaceful place, with an intense smell of some type of aromatic resin. The light from torches reflects off the four statues placed along the walls, projecting twisted shadows on the flagstones. Two unlit incense burners flank an altar sculped from a single stone. A fifth statue, bigger than the others, lies in pieces at the back of the chapel. A staircase in the southeast corner leads back to ground level</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="corridor-to-the-library-3-">Corridor to the Library (3)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>A long corridor connects the Temple with the rest of the School. Three sturdy wooden doors open into the sanctuary dedicated to the Goddess of Magic. </p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="the-library-4-">The Library (4)</h1>
<p>The Great Library is the heart of the School. Thousands of books there contain the knowledge accumulated over the years by the residents of the Academy. The only magical object found in the place is a Pedestal of Reading located in the corner near the Library’s archive. With enough time, a character can find almost any academic information that interests them.</p>
<p>Searching without an index is difficult. Players can locate any book that interests them passing a <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html">Search</a> (DC 12) check. These references can give them a +6 bonus to any knowledge check.</p>
<h1 id="the-observatory-5-">The Observatory (5)</h1>
<p>This circular room serves as an astronomical observatory. An opening in the ceiling enables you to look at the sky through a telescope located under the opening.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A huge copper telescope takes center place in this circular room, while a pane in the ceiling allows you to see the open sky above the School. Astronomy charts hang on the walls and a mahogany table is covered with papers containing notes on constellations, studies on astral rotation, and other astronomy calculations. Varias astral movement models surround the telescope</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="monstrous-anatomy-laboratory-6-">Monstrous Anatomy Laboratory (6)</h1>
<p>This laboratory is dedicated to the study of the anatomy of living beings. With the years, it has become a taxidermy museum and exhibits all kinds of dissected animals and monsters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A pungent odor of formic acid and tanning alum assaults the noses of anyone who opens the door to this room. A small exhibition of dissected animals and monsters watches you from behind the glass cases that line the walls, and two dissection tables display the remains of the entrails and mutilated bodies of small rodents.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="alchemy-laboratory-7-">Alchemy Laboratory (7)</h1>
<p>In this room, Miss Bilwa teaches the students to create potions and elixirs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two large tables, their surfaces criss-crossed with grooves from the use of acidic ingredients, stand in the middle of the room. Stills and vials occupy most of the desks. On the walls, glass cabinets house all kinds of bottles, pouches and boxes containing strange ingredients for spells and an array for studying magic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html">Search</a> (DC 11) check will reveal two <a href="SRD_Cure_Light_Wounds.html">Cure Light Wounds</a> potions, four for <a href="SRD_Darkvision_Spell.html">Darkvision</a>, two for <a href="SRD_Alchemist_Fire.html">Alchemist Fire</a> and a <a href="SRD_Dust_of_Disappearance.html">Dust of Disappearance</a>. In the cabinets, players can find almost any ingredient for spells that they could need.</p>
<h1 id="main-classroom-8-">Main Classroom (8)</h1>
<p>This room is where the majority of lessons take place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three long rows of tables and chairs, facing a desk covered in books and scrolls, occupy nearly the whole room. An enormous blackboard silently extends over the entire south wall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is nothing of value in this room, only books and notes belonging to students at the School.</p>
<h1 id="library-archive-9-">Library Archive (9)</h1>
<p>This room contains the archive that serves as a catalog of the books stored in the Library.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This dry, dim room houses the Library Archive. Thousands of alphabetized files are sheltered in drawers that fill the room. Two consulting tables complete the furniture. A rusted metal staircase descends into the School’s underground passages</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players can use the archive to locate any book that may interest them passing a <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html">Search</a> (DC 6) check. These references can give them a +6 bonus on any knowledge check.</p>
<p>The staircase leads to Professor Nizgul’s room.</p>
<h1 id="professor-glaucom-s-room-10-">Professor Glaucom’s Room (10)</h1>
<p>These are the quarters of the late Professor Glaucom. For a more detailed description, go to <a href="./encounter.html?param=@glaucom">Aposentos de Glaucom</a>.
During the attack, the door is locked. Opening it requires an <a href="SRD_Open_Lock_Skill.html">Open Lock</a> (DC 21) check or <a href="SRD_Breaking_and_Entering.html#Breaking_and_Entering">Break the Door</a> for 10 and 30 strike points of resistance.</p>
<h1 id="principal-s-office-11-">Principal’s Office (11)</h1>
<p>The Principal’s office is the room where Lormam works, meets with the other teachers, and deals with matters relating to the running of the School.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An imposing desk dominates Principal Lormam’s office, a Spartan room where function prevails over esthetics. A simple round table with four chairs and a small bookshelf complete the room’s furniture</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If players search through the papers on the desk, they can find uninteresting notes about the academic plan and other documents related to the running of the School. In one of the drawers in the desk, there is a Wand for Detecting Magic with 15 charges, and a key. Any thief in the group can deduce that it is a master key that opens any door in the School.</p>
<h1 id="principal-s-room-12-">Principal’s Room (12)</h1>
<p>This is the room where Principal Lormam rests after a tiring day’s work in the School.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Principal Lormam’s private quarters are at odds with the sobriety of his office. An elegant bed covered with exotic animal skins rests on a sumptuous tasseled rug, while a closet - hand-carved by a fine cabinetmaker - leans against the south wall. A tapestry on the west wall shows a traditional scene of a group of people in a popular celebration of some kind in a town square. Seven marble busts, each the size of a giant’s fist, stare defiantly out from between the books on the shelf to the east of the room. Finally, a wooden chest, locked with a padlock, sits in the northeast corner of the room</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The marble busts on the bookshelf represent former principals of the School. Lormam likes to think that they are watching over the Academy’s best interests from beyond the grave. In his moments of vicissitude or frustration, he likes to find in the stony gazes of his predecessors the strength he needs to continue his work. With a <a href="SRD_Knowledge_Skill.html">Local History</a> (DC 4) check, a player will find out that the busts show the seven former principals of the School and their names.</p>
<p>The chest in the northeast corner contains a small amount of gold, used by Lormam for payments related to the School. It can be opened passing an <a href="SRD_Open_Lock_Skill.html">Open Lock</a> (DC 12) check. Inside, there are three small leather pouches containing 25 silver coins each.</p>
<p>A <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html">Search</a> (DC 16) check, or by looking directly behind the tapestry, players will find a space hollowed out in the stone wall. There is a leather pouch sitting there. It is a <a href="SRD_Bag_of_Holding.html">bag of holding (type I)</a> containing a <a href="SRD_Cure_Moderate_Wounds.html">Curar Heridas Moderadas</a> potion, 20 gold coins, a <a href="SRD_Gem_of_Brightness.html">Gem of Brightness</a> and a <a href="SRD_Pearl_of_Power.html">Pearl of Power</a>.</p>
<h1 id="librarian-s-room-13-">Librarian’s Room (13)</h1>
<p>The old librarian spends his nights in this room, among files and old books.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A dimly lit room houses the belongings of the old librarian. Dozens of books and scrolls are piled on the floor. A table covered in papers and tomes holds the only candle lighting the chamber. There are even books on the bed, which seems to suggest that the old man does not spend much of his time sleeping</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html">Search</a> (DC 7) check among the papers on the desk reveals some <a href="SRD_Wizard_Spectacles.html">Wizard Spectacles</a>.</p>
<h1 id="miss-bilwa-s-room-14-">Miss Bilwa’s Room (14)</h1>
<p>Miss Bilwa’s room is the largest bedroom in the whole School. She uses it as her quarters and as a laboratory for creating her famous elixirs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Miss Bilwa’s quarters are divided into two; an alchemy laboratory, and a bedroom. The laboratory, in the northern part of the chamber, is made up of two tables covered with vials and bottles, where the sorceress prepares her potions. The southern part of the room is taken up by a large bed covered by garishly colored quilts and cushions, a full-length golden mirror, and a wardrobe filled with luxurious dresses. An open trunk is against the east wall, containing a wide selection of hats. There is also a Repairing Coat Stand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the tables, at the discretion of the Master, players can find several potions and oils made by Miss Bilwa.</p>
<p>Two of Miss Bilwa’s dresses are of exceptional quality and decorated with small gems. They could sell for up to 100mo each, if the right buyer can be found.</p>
<h1 id="gallery-of-spirits-15-">Gallery of Spirits (15)</h1>
<p>This passageway is used for receiving guests to the School, as well as new students starting their courses. The Gallery of Spirits is the name it is known by among the students, due to a legend that says that years ago, a deranged sorcerer murdered several of his colleagues there. According to the story, the spirits of those killed appear to the residents of the School from time to time to warn them of dangers. A <a href="SRD_Knowledge_Skill.html">Local History</a> (DC 5) check will give the players this information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This passageway is completely empty. It is only used on occasion throughout the year, to hold receptions or important events at the School. It is then that the Academy’s employees place chairs there, and a podium where the Principal addresses attendees.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="rooms-16-">Rooms (16)</h1>
<p>These are the rooms of the first-year students. The youngest students have in their rooms a bed, a desk, and a container for keeping their belongings in. If players observe the area they will find: 1d4x5mp and 1d6-3 objets d’art with a value of 10mo each. </p>
<h1 id="map-room-17-">Map Room (17)</h1>
<p>This room is a small library, dedicated to storing all the cartographical knowledge accumulated by the mages over the years. Some easels hold up a relief map of the entire continent, which takes up nearly the whole room. There are numerous maps hanging on the walls, and two shelves housing folders of atlases and sailing maps. If players <a href="SRD_Search_Skill.html">Search</a> (DC 5), they will find plans of the School, the city, and the surrounding areas. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A huge relief map of the continent, held up by a study oak easel, takes up most of this room, while several maps hang on the walls. Two glass bookcases house dozens of folders</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="tearoom-18-">Tearoom (18)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>A room with its floor covered in cushions and a couple of teapots serves as a meeting point where students of the School can relax, chat, and spend some time enjoying the different teas.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="main-dining-room-19-">Main Dining Room (19)</h1>
<p>The students of the School gather here three times a day to be fed. There is no decoration of any kind, and the air stinks of stew and cooked fish</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Four long wooden tables and numerous stools fill the space in this room flanked by two huge chimneys, their embers glowing. The smell of food impregnates the air, creating a heavy and unpleasant atmosphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="entry-hall-20-">Entry Hall (20)</h1>
<p>The walls of the School’s entry area pay tribute to the Academy’s former students and teachers. Hundreds of portraits cover the walls, to the extent that it is difficult to make out the stone behind the jumble of framed paintings. A <a href="SRD_Spot_Skill.html">Spot</a> (DC 12) check will reveal a small frame in the upper left corner of the west wall, covered by a moldy rag. If players can reach it and lift the rag, they will discover the print of a young mage with a sarcastic smile. The frame reads <em>Black Skull</em>. A <a href="SRD_Knowledge_Skill.html#Knowledge_.28Int.3B_Trained_Only.29">History</a> (DC 10) check will reveal to the players that he is an ex-student of the School who, after leaving the Academy, became an infamous sorcerer in the north of the continent. After learning of his horrible crimes, the Principal decided to cover his picture as a sign of condemnation of his acts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pictures swarm the walls of the School’s entry room. From top to bottom and north to south, hundreds of portraits cover the walls. Each painting shows the portrait of a former student or teacher at the Academy, with their name printed on the frame.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="gallery-of-inventions-21-">Gallery of Inventions (21)</h1>
<p>This long corridor contains a small exhibition of artefacts and mechanical contraptions created by teachers and students of the School over the years.
The display also includes a large collection of clocks, whose perpetual tick-tock pervades the space. Every hour, they unite in a cacophony of chimes that can be heard throughout the School.
Among all the room’s gadgets, there are a few relevant magical objects: The <a href="SRD_Ring_of_Water_Walking.html">Boots for Crossing Rushing Waters</a> and <a href="SRD_Hat_of_Disguise.html">The Mask of Caricature</a>, both creations of a former student known as Ki. A pair of Iron Golems used to guard the passageway, but they were dismantled some time ago due to the danger posed to students’ safety when, distracted, they entered the corridor at some ungodly hour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Gallery of Inventions is one of the School’s main hallways. The large space is home to a curious exhibition of mechanical artefacts created by residents of the Academy over the years. Metallic birds whose wings beat, automatons that recite poems, and all sorts of small wind-up toys whose technical complexity will amaze observers. The north wall is covered with countless clocks, of all sizes and materiales, whose perpetual tick-tock marks the passing of time. Two imposing metal figures, each two meters tall, observe visitors with an absent gaze</p>

Inside, there is a metal box with a <a href="SRD_Open_Lock_Skill.html#bodyContent">lock</a> (DC 20). Inside that, there are 200 gold coins and the property deeds to a ranch in the south of the continent that was recently bought. Wrapped in a small velvet cloth is a key: it is a copy of Professor Lormam’s master key, which can open every door in the School. Some time ago, Menzal got hold of the key, and since then has been siphoning off small amounts of money from the Chamber of Treasures. It is thanks to this “extra income” that he has managed to scrape together enough money to buy a farm where he can retire.</p>

<p>The Guards’ Tower is the closest building to the School of Magic, and is linked to the Academy by <strong>a tunnel</strong> that leads out into the Guards’ Barracks (room 30)</p>

<p>Sâlorium Fortress towers above the rest of the city’s buildings, offering citizens a halo of safety with its mere presence.

<h1 id="the-cemetery-4-">The Cemetery (4)</h1>
<p>Sâlorium’s graveyard is one of the oldest areas in the city. It was formerly found outside the city walls, but with the development of the city, it is now incorporated inside.</p>
<h1 id="the-bridge-5-">The Bridge (5)</h1>
<p>This is one of the bridges that connect the two halves of the city separated by the River Orium. It is the only bridge that is in a good condition, which causes major congestion, especially on market day. A Guard patrol directs people through the walkway to regulate carriage and pedestrian traffic. Fights and brawls among citizens are a common occurrence, and more than one riot has broken out due to the delays and inconveniences caused by the congestion on the viaduct.</p>
<h1 id="the-broken-bridge-6-">The Broken Bridge (6)</h1>
<p>This bridge was washed away by the river some years ago, and has been in a state of disuse since - despite complaints from neighbors. Those in charge of the city keep promising to repair the bridge, but work has not yet started.</p>

<h1 id="situation">SITUATION</h1>
<p>The tunnels that make up the system underneath the School of Magic are carved from solid rock. The walls and floors have been polished to a shine, lending a clean appearance to the tunnels. Every 10 meters, there is an empty holder on the wall for placing torches in. The only light sources in the place are those visitors carry with them, except in the corridor of the Chamber of Treasures, where magic torches are burning around the clock.</p>
<p>A subterranean river, branching off the River Orium, runs under the School and leads to the basements constructed underground. Residents of the Academy use it as a water source, which they access using the well on the Courtyard, and for disposing of waste from the toilets.</p>
<p>The entrances to the Underground Passages are found in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trap door in the <a href="./lugares.html?param=@escuela-map&amp;room=11">Principal’s office</a>.</li>
<li>Secret door in the <a href="./lugares.html?param=@dungeon-map&amp;room=1">Temple Crypt</a>. </li>
<li>Stair that leads to Nizgul’s room from <a href="./lugares.html?param=@escuela-map&amp;room=9">Library Archive</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current is strong and drags anything floating on it southeast-northeast. Swimming in these waters requires a <em>Athletics</em> (DC 10) check if going with the current, and (DC 15) if going against it.</p>
<p>You can walk along the edge of the river during your time beneath the School.</p>
<p>If players immerse themselves in these dark waters, at the discretion of the Master they may have an encounter with 1d2  <a href="SRD_Dire_Rat.html">Dire Rats</a> </p>
<p>The only area illuminated by torches is the area of the <a href="./lugares.html?param=@dungeon-map&amp;room=3">bridge</a> that crosses the stream, connecting Professor Nizgul’s Laboratory with the passageway to the Chamber of Treasures. </p>

<h1 id="characteristics-of-the-school">CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SCHOOL</h1>
<p>The School of Magic was the first building in Sâlorium, and the rest of the city sprang up around it. In the beginning, it was a fortress built in order to protect this part of the continent from the hordes of orks and monsters that live in the North. Due to its defensive nature, the School is built with strong, windowless masonry walls, and it is surrounded by a huge rampart, that has been besieged by armies and hordes over the centuries. When it was converted into a School, the building underwent some small refurbishments, such as the construction of the Observatory, but its military nature is still apparent in its structure.</p>
<h3 id="walls-">Walls:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Interior Walls: The interior walls of the School are built from stone and are 1 meter thick. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Rampart and Exterior Walls: Both the rampart and the School’s exterior walls are 2 meters thick. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="heights-">Heights:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Exterior: The School is 6 meters high, except in the case of the Library, Observatory, and Temple, which reach up to 18 meters in height. </li>
<li>Rooms: The rooms, unless otherwise specified, are 5 meters high. </li>
<li>Corridors: The corridors, unless otherwise specified, are 5 meters high. </li>
<li>Underground Passages: The underground passages are a little over 2 meters high.</li>
<li>Rampart: The walls surrounding the School Courtyard are 8 meters high. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="floors">Floors</h3>
<p>The School’s floor is made of polished stone slabs. Unless otherwise specified, movement on the surface is normal. </p>
<h3 id="lighting">Lighting</h3>
<p>Due to its defensive origins, the School has no windows, so inside illumination depends on artificial lighting. Corridors and main bedrooms have torches on which a permanent Light spell has been cast. In this Adventure, due to the Dispel Magic spell cast on the School, this magic has been dispelled, plunging the Academy into the blackest of darknesses. In the rooms there are lanterns, torches and candles used by residents of the building.</p>
<p></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Localizaciones Dungeon" tags="lugares @dungeon-map" position="457,624" size="100,100"></p>
<h1 id="crypt">Crypt</h1>
<p>The Temple basement is a damp, dank place. Greenish mold flourishes between the ashlar walls and the floor slabs. If this place ever had a purpose, it must have been long ago, because there is no trace left of its use.</p>
<h1 id="chamber-of-treasures">Chamber of Treasures</h1>
<p>The Chamber used by the School Principal for storing the Academy’s treasures is a simple room with whitewashed walls. A huge metal plate with a wheel mechanism and a lock prevents curious people from entering.</p>
<p><strong>Tesoro</strong>: Four gold ingots worth 300mo each. 200 copper coins, 100 silver coins, 68 gold coins, three gems for 50 silver coins each, five <a href="SRD_Potions.html#Table:_Potions_and_Oils">Potions of Cure Light Wounds</a>, a <a href="SRD_Potions.html#Table:_Potions_and_Oils">Potion of Levitate</a>, a <a href="SRD_Wands.html#Table:_Wands">Wand of Fireball</a> (with 4 charges) and a <a href="SRD_Bag_of_Holding.html">minor bag of holding</a>. There is also a <a href="SRD_Magic_Weapons.html#bodyContent">magic weapon</a> (+1) suitable for each of the characters.</p>
<h1 id="bridge">Bridge</h1>
<p>A rotting wooden bridge leads across the underground river. Despite its weakened appearance, the planks are well able to bear the weight of several people at a time.</p>
<h1 id="nizgul-s-laboratory">Nizgul’s Laboratory</h1>
<p>The necromancer Nizgul’s room is located underneath the Library Archive (9). It is a large room that serves as both a bedroom and a laboratory. The smell of chemical products is unbearable, and the fact that the Professor was able to sleep in the same room as some of his necromantic experiments gives an idea of how disturbed he was.</p>
<h1 id="nizgul-s-storeroom">Nizgul’s Storeroom</h1>
<p>This room is lined with floor-to-ceiling shelves. They are covered with vials and glass jars containing all manner of ingredients for spells, from exotic to mundane natural chemical products. Nothing is labeled or classified - Professor Nizgul had memorized the position and contents of every container.</p>
<h1 id="latrine">Latrine</h1>
<p>This latrine gives access to the underground river. </p>
<h1 id="courtyard-well">Courtyard Well</h1>
<p>This well gives access to the underground river. </p>
<h1 id="secret-door">Secret Door</h1>
<p>This secret door gives access to the Temple of Magic. </p>
