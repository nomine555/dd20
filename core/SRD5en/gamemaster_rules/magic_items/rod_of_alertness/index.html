<p><em>Rod, very rare (requires attunement)</em> </p>
<p>This rod has a flanged head and the following properties.  <br/>
<strong>Alertness.</strong> While holding the rod, you have <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/index.html">Advantage</a> on <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/abilities/wisdom/index.html">Wisdom</a> (Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.  <br/>
<strong>Spells.</strong> While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/detect_evil_and_good/index.html">Detect Evil and Good</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/detect_magic/index.html">Detect Magic</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/detect_poison_and_disease/index.html">Detect Poison and Disease</a></em></strong>, or <strong><em>*See <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/spellcasting/spells/invisibility/index.html">Invisibility</a>*</em></strong>.  <br/>
<strong>Protective Aura.</strong> As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any <a href="../../../../../core/SRD5en/rules/conditions/index.html">Invisible</a> hostile creature that is also in the bright light.  <br/>
The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p></div>
