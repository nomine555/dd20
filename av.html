It was part of a collection once owned by the renowned Yellowcrest family of Waterdeep. As he presented the book as payment for entry into Candlekeep, Sirok told the Avowed priests a grim story of how the patriarch of the family, Lord Yellowcrest, had returned to Waterdeep from a business trip to find his wife, their three children, and the house's four servants all murdered. In the aftermath of this terrible loss, the grieving lord sold all his possessions, then moved away from the city to live out his life in solitude.</p><p>Sirok never got around to reading the book, and his story about the Yellowcrests was something he learned from gossiping acquaintances. The dark pedigree of Sirok's donation was soon forgotten, and <i>Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor</i> was cataloged and placed into the library's archives, where it has gone unnoticed ever since.</p><hr class="rd__hr rd__hr--section"><div class="rd__b  rd__b--0"><span class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="2" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Beginning the Adventure</span></span> <p>The adventure begins when the ghost of a young woman named Sarah appears before the characters as they peruse the stacks of Candlekeep. The reason that Sarah's ghost is able to manifest for the first time to the characters, after five years of silence, is left to your judgment. The spirit of the murdered woman might be drawn to a character who is dedicated to law or good, one whose background features a similar tragedy, or one who struggled to rise from poverty as she did. Alternatively, if one of the characters has a penchant for reading books from Candlekeep's shelves at random, you might have Sarah appear because her story is being read for the first time since her diary came to the library.</p><p><i>Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor</i> is a nondescript general text, so it fits best in some forgotten corner of the library where tomes of no particular interest are stored. Read or paraphrase the following when you're ready to begin the adventure:</p><div class="rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud "><p>The air around you grows suddenly chilly. A cloud of vapor begins to shimmer along the nearby shelves, growing thicker around a nondescript leather-bound book. The mist suddenly coalesces into the vague form of a young woman—a translucent spirit wearing a servant's uniform and bearing the symbol of a tree outlined by a rising sun at her shoulder.</p><p>The figure weeps aloud, tears running down her cheeks. She opens her mouth as if to speak—which reveals that her tongue is gone. Moaning in anguish, she reaches toward you. Then the mist shreds away to nothing, and the spirit fades.</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><span class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="3" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Book Description</span></span> <p><i>Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor</i> is a leather-bound book with brass corner fittings and an intricately carved brass clasp that holds the book shut.

Only a handful of pages at the end of the book remain so. The rest are filled with handwriting that starts out crude but slowly becomes more elegant, hinting that it was produced by a person learning to write, who then practiced their writing by keeping a diary.</p><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><span class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="4" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">A Humble Life</span></span> <p>The pages of <i>Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor</i> are a mixture of exercises, drawings, and reminiscences. The earliest pages bear nothing but repetitions of the name "Sarah." Lists of household chores, pending activities, shopping lists, and names take up a full third of the book.</p><p>Where the diary begins, the book becomes a firsthand account (written in Common) of the life of Sarah, who describes herself as a servant in the Waterdeep manor of Lord Viallis Yellowcrest and Lady Maria Yellowcrest. The diary entries are not on consecutive pages, and most are undated. In addition to writing about her daily obligations and life in the manor, Sarah also wrote about Lady Maria, who came from a poor family and empathized with Sarah's own lack of education. Lady Maria's genuine affection for Sarah led her to teach the young servant to write, and to give her the leather-bound book that became the diary.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--2"><span class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="5" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">A Glimpse of Darkness</span></span> <p>The last entries of the diary, dated just over five years earlier, change in tone as Sarah worries about the strange conduct of Lord Yellowcrest, and his habit of spending too much time with ancient books in his study. The final diary entry reads:</p><div class="rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud "><p>I stole close to Lord Viallis today, and saw that he had chalked a circle marked with strange runes across the floor of his study. A puddle spread within the circle and appeared to me as bubbling blood. Lord Viallis stood next to it motionless, one of his vile books in hand, and muttered something I could not hear. I slipped away quickly, though I fear he might have heard me this time. I have never been so scared, but I must tell Lady Maria what I have seen. I must!</p><div class="float-clear"></div></div><p>In her diary, Sarah tried to draw the image of the cover of an old tome Lord Viallis was reading. The sketch shows a monstrous creature with a bulbous head, long arms, tentacles for legs, and multifaceted eyes (see "<a href="#cm,9,lord%20viallis's%20tome,0" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseOver(event, this, 2, {&quot;isLargeBookContent&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:0})" onmousemove="Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseMove(event, this)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handlePredefinedMouseLeave(event, this)" ontouchstart="Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)">Lord Viallis's Tome</a>" later in the adventure for more information).</p><p>Sarah also attempted to sketch what she remembered of the rune-marked circle.

Alternatively, if the characters call Sarah back (see below) and are able to communicate with her, you can allow the poor servant's spirit to reveal some of this information:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Yellowcrest Manor stands on Delzorin Street in Waterdeep's North Ward.</li><li class="rd__li ">Lord Viallis and Lady Maria had two sons, Malik and Janus, and one daughter, Tianna.</li><li class="rd__li ">The family owned several tanneries and shoemaking shops in Waterdeep, but most of its wealth was inherited on Maria's side.</li><li class="rd__li ">Lord Viallis's closest business associate was an elf named Faerl, who visited Lord Viallis twice a tenday.</li><li class="rd__li ">Sarah had a romantic relationship with a young squire named Vecken, who lived close to the manor on Immar Street.</li></ul><p>The details of the murders at Yellowcrest Manor can be learned from a few hours' research into recent Waterdeep history, or by consulting any scholar at the library who has an interest in that history or the noble families of Waterdeep. The public details of the dark event are well known:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">Lord Yellowcrest was away from Waterdeep on business, then returned to find his wife, his sons and daughter, and the manor's four servants brutally murdered. Shocked into a deep depression by the tragedy, Lord Yellowcrest left Waterdeep to be alone with his grief.</li><li class="rd__li ">Rumors seemingly spread by members of the City Guard after investigating the murders hinted at some sort of cult activity, but details of the killings were never revealed. No suspects were ever identified or charged.</li><li class="rd__li ">The Yellowcrest family had a good reputation, with no hint of personal or public impropriety.

The ritual was successful, and with the magic circle he had scribed, Viallis established contact with a Great Old One called Gaernoo. This aberrant patron offered to grant Lord Viallis arcane powers in exchange for establishing a cult dedicated to Gaernoo.</p><p>Lord Viallis, empowered by Gaernoo's otherworldly magic and wanting to get away from talk of his family's death, moved to the village of Greenfast, a day's travel southeast of Waterdeep and the home of his business partner, Faerl. Claiming that he wanted to have his family interred close to him, he took the remains of his wife and children along, with evil intent. For the last five years, Viallis has been building a cult to Gaernoo around himself, calling it the Burnt Tongue Cult for the sacrifice that new members must make before being accepted.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--1"><span class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="10" data-title-relative-index="0"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Lord Viallis's Tome</span></span> <p>The crude sketch composed by Sarah shows the monster on the leather-bound cover of the book Lord Viallis was reading.
